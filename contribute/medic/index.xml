&lt;p>The Medic Product Team operates in a way that is most commonly referred to as &lt;a href="https://docs.communityhealthtoolkit.org/contribute/medic/product-development-process/continuous-discovery-overview/">Continuous Discovery&lt;/a>. That process helps us to focus on the impact of our work and keep teammates well-aligned with the people who use the CHT.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To allow teammates to truly learn from and empathize with those using the CHT, the Medic Product team has cross-functional subteams, called &lt;a href="https://docs.communityhealthtoolkit.org/contribute/medic/product-development-process/focused-groups/">Focused Working Groups&lt;/a>, each aligned with different user types. Each group is focused on a specific set of users of the CHT and has an aligned roadmap. Roadmaps are made up of defined initiatives, which map to goals and strategies. There is a big emphasis on working towards outcomes (not only &lt;em>outputs&lt;/em>). Product teammates work together, across disciplines, to understand opportunities for improvement, find solutions that will have an impact, and then build, deploy, and measure them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As part of responsible maintainers of a software system, software engineers also dedicate time to performing &lt;a href="https://docs.communityhealthtoolkit.org/contribute/medic/product-development-process/code-health/">Code Health&lt;/a> tasks. That ensures updates, upgrades, code enhancements, and small bugs are still handled while the team works on highly focused user-facing objectives.
Each Focused Working Group has defined Objectives and Key Results (OKRs), which set their focus for a given quarter. These, in turn, are derived from the Product Team&amp;rsquo;s yearly Objective Goals Strategies Measurements (OGSMs). The &lt;a href="https://docs.communityhealthtoolkit.org/contribute/medic/product-development-process/schedule-of-events/">Schedule of Activities&lt;/a> has more on the timing of all this through out any given year.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Contribute: Product Team Core Competencies</title><link>https://docs.communityhealthtoolkit.org/contribute/medic/product-core-competencies/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://docs.communityhealthtoolkit.org/contribute/medic/product-core-competencies/</guid><description>
