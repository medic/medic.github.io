&lt;p>The goal of this page is to convey a general “lay of the land” so someone starting can see a lot of what’s out there related to Product Team without having to be surprised each day as new things pop up.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="about-product-team">About Product Team&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The Product Team manages the entire software development life-cycle to understand problems, capture requirements, design and build modular software systems, and document everything along the way.
We achieve this by working with CHT partners and health workers to design, build, and maintain the Community Health Toolkit and its open source tools.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="composition">Composition&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The Product Team comprises a Community Team and 4 Focused Working Groups, each focusing on outcomes to serve different people.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="focused-working-groups">Focused Working Groups&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The Product Team operates in a way that is most commonly referred to as Continuous Discovery. That process helps us to focus on the impact of our work and keep teammates well-aligned with the people who use the CHT. Read more about the process &lt;a href="https://docs.communityhealthtoolkit.org/contribute/medic/product-development-process/">here&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Each Focused Working Group serves to different user types to understand opportunities for improvement, find solutions that will have an impact, and then build, deploy, and measure them. Find out more about the different Focused Working Groups &lt;a href="https://docs.communityhealthtoolkit.org/contribute/medic/product-development-process/focused-groups/">here&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="community-team">Community Team&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The community team builds and supports the CHT community of practitioners to ensure that community members can actively use and contribute to the CHT.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Key users: Core Developers, App Developers, digital health implementers, research organizations, ministries of health, academic institutions and individual contributors.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Team members:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Director of Community.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Technical Writer.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Developer Advocate.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Community Manager.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>CHT Round-up calls: Monthly calls aimed at engaging the CHT community, sharing CHT product updates and getting valuable feedback from the CHT community. See previous Round-up calls &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLutu6_ZOg77dO_aqf4Zh1ck59YnHzWuPI">here&lt;/a>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Contribute: All The Things</title><link>https://docs.communityhealthtoolkit.org/contribute/medic/onboarding/all-the-things/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://docs.communityhealthtoolkit.org/contribute/medic/onboarding/all-the-things/</guid><description>
&lt;p>This page is meant to serve as a point of conversation, with a wide range of topics to be discussed when joining Medic or starting as a contributor. Many things are not in any particular order. The goal is to convey a general “lay of the land” so someone starting can see a lot of what’s out there without having to be surprised each day as new things pop up.&lt;/p>

&lt;div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
&lt;h4 class="alert-heading">Note&lt;/h4>
This page also contains Medic internal documentation links that are only accessible to Medic team members.
&lt;/div>
&lt;p>This page contains materials that will help a CHT Contributor to master all the technical details they need to be successful when building tools related to the CHT. For Medic team members, this content is complimentary on a technical level to the Onboarding documents shared by the Internal Operations team.
Keep in mind that this is a living document, and every contributor is encouraged to add to it when identifying learning opportunities that can set them up for success with the CHT. The main goal here is to provide the technical people who are new to the CHT with a list of resources that could be beneficial for them in both the short and long term. However, the expectation is not to complete every course listed in this document but instead to share some resources that other contributors found helpful. It is valid if you prefer to use other training material, as long as you cover the skill/topic during the onboarding. That means you will need to learn JavaScript, TypeScript, Docker, CouchDB, and others mentioned in the “Skills” column, as you will use them in your day-to-day activities, and the list provided in the “Resources” column is meant to support you in this. It is OK if you prefer to learn with alternative resources.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
&lt;h4 class="alert-heading">Note&lt;/h4>
Some of the suggestions below could be for internal courses and/or material created and maintained by other teammates at Medic, free resources on the internet, or paid courses, which for Medic teammates could be considered as part of the &lt;a href="https://www.notion.so/Professional-Development-f5fc299ecf984dacbd65100af100ed14">Professional Development Benefit&lt;/a> at Medic.
&lt;/div>
&lt;h2 id="exercises">Exercises&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>There is a Slack channel &lt;em>#exercism&lt;/em> where engineers and tech enthusiasts meet and discuss JavaScript and TypeScript exercises from &lt;a href="https://exercism.org/">exercism.org&lt;/a> on a weekly basis. The primary goal of this channel is to discuss with your teammates and have a fun, open discussion on how the provided solutions can be improved, while also having the opportunity to connect with people from other teams. Even though this is optional, it is highly encouraged to join and participate frequently.&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="product-team-monthly-call">Product Team Monthly Call&lt;/h2>
&lt;h3 id="why">Why&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Getting to see each other all in one place at the same time, even if only online, lets people get to be around each other, learn from each other, and hear other perspectives. We&amp;rsquo;re real people! &amp;hellip;terrific people too. This is a small space to spend some time around each other as a group. We&amp;rsquo;re mostly trying to learn more about each other, celebrate recent successes, and cover the occasional big news or team-wide changes. It&amp;rsquo;s mostly about being together to smile a bit.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="when">When&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Roughly the first Tuesday (or Wednesday, for New Zealand teammates) week of each month.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="who-is-there">Who is there&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The whole Product Team.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="who-facilitates-it">Who facilitates it&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Maybe you! We&amp;rsquo;ll have a rotation of teammates leading the call. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean you give a 2-hour speech at your teammates. It just means you help out with some basic logistics and guide us through the loose segments so it&amp;rsquo;s not chaos.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="how-to-facilitate-it">How to facilitate it&lt;/h3>
&lt;h4 id="preparations">Preparations&lt;/h4>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>About 2 weeks before the call, open the &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/14AuJ7SerLuOPESBjQlJqpBtzwSAoVf5ykTT7fjyJBT0/edit#heading=h.tpmdaeagi9ap">Product Team Call&lt;/a> document and:
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Add a new date token for &amp;ldquo;question of the week&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Randomize the list of teammate names.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Put the name of whoever ended up first on the randomized list as the question of the week person.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Notify that person via Slack that they should think up a question and add it to the doc any time prior to the call. Special note: If we have a new teammate, they give to be first and set the question. Just modify the list to make it so.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The last randomized person on the list will be in charge of &amp;ldquo;activity of the week&amp;rdquo; (anything small and fun we can all do together. Past activities have included &lt;a href="https://www.geoguessr.com/">GeoGuessr&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://garticphone.com/">Gartic Phone&lt;/a>, and &lt;a href="https://kahoot.com/">Kahoot trivia&lt;/a>).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Notify that person via Slack that they should find such an activity and be prepared to lead it for us all.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Create a new Jamboard in the &lt;a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1jV-8APqEQ85MOr1Irc4vRKRuKZOmI1r_">team meeting folder&lt;/a>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Make the Jamboard accessible for all teammates&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Link it in the agenda under &amp;ldquo;Celebrations and good fun stuff&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Send a message to the whole team in Slack so they know the jamboard is available and can start putting fun things on it, and also that the agenda is open now for team-wide or org information to add.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;h4 id="running-the-call-on-the-day-of">Running the call on the day-of&lt;/h4>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Start the call on time (mostly). We can&amp;rsquo;t sit around forever, but this is mostly a fun thing, so it&amp;rsquo;s ok if people are just chatting for a couple minutes while waiting for stragglers.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Say hello and all that.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Do the question of the week activity.
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Sometimes people get the order mixed up. Be prepared to nudge people if needed.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Move to the regular agenda. If there are special items, someone&amp;rsquo;s name should be on it already.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Do the Jamboard.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Ask for someone to mark the cards as you call them out. Enough people seem to take joy in this, and it&amp;rsquo;ll be a thing all on its own!&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Note which card you&amp;rsquo;re looking at, read it, and ask if anyone (or the author) wants to add more. Sometimes it&amp;rsquo;s quick stuff, sometimes it&amp;rsquo;s big fun things everyone wants to spend more time on. Cool.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Pass the mic to the activity of the week person.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Fin! (It&amp;rsquo;s ok if we finish early. We need to try hard not to finish late; it&amp;rsquo;s evening for some teammates!).&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;h2 id="product-team-social-time">Product Team Social Time&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>People appreciate social time, so we will use this weekly time to connect with each other rather than share updates. It is a perfect place to discuss a (non) technical issue you are encountering and ask for support from colleagues.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Product Team Social Time is optional, but highly encouraged. You can choose the schedule that works best for you (2 calls on Mondays 10AM GMT and 9PM GMT).&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="frequently-asked-questions">Frequently Asked Questions&lt;/h3>
&lt;h4 id="q-what-if-im-alone-in-the-product-social-time">Q: What if I&amp;rsquo;m alone in the product social time?&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>A: You don’t need to wait for more than 5 or 10 minutes if no one else shows up.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="q-how-frequently-should-i-go-to-the-product-social-time">Q: How frequently should I go to the product social time?&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>A: You are not required to join this call, but it is highly encouraged as we’d like teammates to connect not only via Slack or GitHub.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="q-is-the-product-social-time-considered-as-part-of-my-performance-review">Q: Is the product social time considered as part of my performance review?&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>A: No, it is not considered a part of the performance review.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Contribute: Daily Updates</title><link>https://docs.communityhealthtoolkit.org/contribute/medic/onboarding/daily-updates/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://docs.communityhealthtoolkit.org/contribute/medic/onboarding/daily-updates/</guid><description>
&lt;h2 id="what">What&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>In our fully remote environment, staying connected and informed is crucial. One of the ways we can ensure transparency, and collaboration, and keep everyone in the loop is by utilizing the &lt;em>#product-dailies&lt;/em> channel in Slack for sharing daily updates.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="who">Who&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>All the Product Team members are expected to share daily updates in Slack (&lt;em>#product-dailies&lt;/em> channel). Due to the nature of their work, Leadership Product colleagues might share less regular, but more consolidated updates.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="why-are-daily-updates-essential">Why are daily updates essential?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Here&amp;rsquo;s why it&amp;rsquo;s relevant:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Transparency&lt;/strong>: By sharing our daily activities, progress, and challenges, we create a transparent work environment. It allows everyone to understand what&amp;rsquo;s happening across the team, fostering trust and alignment.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Collaboration&lt;/strong>: Daily updates enable us to collaborate more effectively. When we know what each team member is working on, it&amp;rsquo;s easier to identify opportunities for support, provide feedback, or even discover potential collaborations.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Accountability&lt;/strong>: Sharing daily updates holds us all accountable for our tasks and goals. It helps us track progress and ensure that we&amp;rsquo;re moving forward on our projects. Plus, it motivates us to stay focused and productive.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Remote Communication&lt;/strong>: In a fully remote setup, communication can sometimes be a challenge. The &lt;em>#product-dailies&lt;/em> channel serves as a centralized hub for communication, making it easier for us to stay connected despite the physical distance.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Celebrating Wins and Learning from Challenges&lt;/strong>: Sharing daily updates isn&amp;rsquo;t just about reporting tasks; it&amp;rsquo;s also about celebrating our wins, big or small, and learning from the challenges we encounter. It allows us to acknowledge achievements, share best practices, and support each other in overcoming obstacles.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Improves team morale&lt;/strong>: Team status updates don’t single out blocked team members. Plus, everyone feels like they are contributing to the team.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>By embracing the &lt;em>#product-dailies&lt;/em> channel and actively participating in sharing our daily updates, we strengthen our team collaboration, enhance transparency, and ultimately drive our collective success.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="what-this-looks-like-in-practice">What this looks like in practice?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Daily updates in the &lt;em>#product-dailies&lt;/em> Slack channel are &lt;em>mandatory&lt;/em> for the whole Product Team.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can find some examples of prompts to answer in your daily update below (Feel free to answer how many you wish. Also, feel free to find another prompts that make more sense to you at the moment when you write your update):&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Are there any blockers or impediments preventing you from doing your work?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>What are your commitments for the day? (if you choose to share your update at the beginning of your day)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>What were your achievements of the day? (if you choose to share your update at the end of your day)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="bad-update-vs-good-update-examples">Bad update vs. good update examples&lt;/h3>
&lt;table>
&lt;thead>
&lt;tr>
&lt;th>Bad update&lt;/th>
&lt;th>Good update&lt;/th>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;/thead>
&lt;tbody>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>Stuck on the login bug all day.&lt;/td>
&lt;td>Investigated a login bug that prevented authentication; the root cause is that Safari doesn’t support the validation library. Tomorrow I’m going to find a solution that supports all browsers and add automation tests.&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>I had 8 meetings today and didn’t have time to do anything else.&lt;/td>
&lt;td>The 1:1s with the engineers today were so exciting! We are planning the Q2 Goals, and we had interesting discussions on how to separate Goals from Grow areas. We finally agreed to use an approach inspired by Lattice&amp;rsquo;s suggestion (with a link). I will use the same approach to set up my Goals tomorrow.&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>Continuing to work on the same thing as yesterday.&lt;/td>
&lt;td>Making progress on [ticket number], today I addressed the testing, by adding 75% of unit test coverage of the new feature.&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>Hey team, today was pretty busy. I did some coding, had a meeting, and did some research. I&amp;rsquo;m calling it a day now&lt;/td>
&lt;td>Today, I completed authentication logic for backend API endpoints and fixed a token validation bug. Collaborated with Roman to refine the user login interface, aligning it with our styling guidelines. Also, provided development updates in the squad traffic lights meeting.&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>- Did Easy Llama course &lt;br> - Met with Phil &lt;br> - Worked on #8819&lt;/td>
&lt;td>- &lt;del>Did Easy Llama course&lt;/del> &lt;br> - Talked with Phil about project boards and Product/Programs work. We settled on having one board and labels on tickets to help Programs teammates view/filter as they need to. &lt;br> - Worked on #8819 and got the refactoring done on the UI code. Next up will be to add a few fields to the API so I can show the data on the screen. UI tests have been frustrating taking a long time to run locally&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>

&lt;h2 id="frequently-asked-questions">Frequently Asked Questions&lt;/h2>
&lt;h3 id="q-what-if-the-channel-becomes-too-noisy">Q: What if the channel becomes too noisy?&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>A: We all work towards the same goals and mission, and the daily updates you share help everyone feel assured that they are on the same page and reduce the chances of misunderstandings and miscommunication. For that reason and all the benefits we listed in the &lt;a href="#why-are-daily-updates-essential">Why section&lt;/a>, we can’t consider updates noise, but bits and pieces of the amazing work we do together! You can always skim through updates that are too technical, for example, or that you are already aware of.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="q-why-would-other-teams-care-about-my-updates">Q: Why would other teams care about my updates?&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>A: Because we should collaborate and care about our team, not just about our individual work. Your updates may bring new opportunities, ideas, concerns, feedback, and more. It also aligns well with being a good communicator who’s helping us improve the team’s accountability.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="q-are-the-daily-updates-mandatory">Q: Are the daily updates mandatory?&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>A: Yes, they are mandatory and also a brilliant opportunity to engage your colleagues, to motivate them, and enhance our collective output. This isn’t just for authority’s sake – if everyone takes daily updates seriously, we will be more productive, aligned and connected as a team.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="q-what-happens-if-i-dont-share-updates-daily">Q: What happens if I don’t share updates daily?&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>A: The goal is maintaining efficient collaboration and ensuring we&amp;rsquo;re all moving towards our objectives. By not communicating with the team, we are affecting collaboration and transparency, at the very least. For each of us, our work is not only about the technical stuff but also about being a good team player, effective communicator, and &lt;a href="https://docs.communityhealthtoolkit.org/contribute/medic/product-core-competencies/">more&lt;/a>. Failure to provide updates may affect your evaluation, potentially impacting opportunities for growth and advancement within the team.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="q-how-often-should-i-post-updates-in-the-daily-channel">Q: How often should I post updates in the daily channel?&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>A: At least once per day, but for some people, more than one update could also work. For instance, their commitments for the day and then what they actually achieved.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="q-what-is-the-best-time-to-post-updates-on-the-daily-channel">Q: What is the best time to post updates on the daily channel?&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>A: Whatever works best for you. But, usually, posting the update could be either one of the first activities you complete or one of the last things you do before leaving for the day. Here’s some interesting &lt;a href="https://blog.xmtp.com/goodbye-standups-hello-wrap-ups/">reading&lt;/a> on the topic.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="q-how-is-this-measured-in-my-performance-review">Q: How is this measured in my performance review?&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>A: Managers will share regular feedback throughout the year about the quality and consistency of your updates. Preferably, by the time performance reviews happen, you will already have received plenty of feedback and identified areas for growth that you committed to working on. Effective communication and reliability are part of our core competencies, and accountability is a big deal we are trying to get better at as a team, so status update consistency will be part of the calibration toward those competencies.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="q-how-detailed-should-my-updates-be">Q: How detailed should my updates be?&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>A: We shared some &lt;a href="#bad-update-vs-good-update-examples">examples of updates&lt;/a> and some prompts that can help you draft your daily updates. Keep in mind that status updates demand clarity and specific information that is valuable and informs others.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="q-what-should-i-do-if-i-have-no-significant-updates-for-the-day">Q: What should I do if I have no significant updates for the day?&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>A: If you don’t have significant updates about what you did, you can always share updates about how you feel about it. Maybe a task was simply straightforward and it doesn’t require many updates. Or maybe there were a number of difficult, unforeseen issues that came up, and you didn’t progress as much as you wanted. Maybe you had a super productive day. Tell the team how you feel; the channel is a safe space to speak honestly! (&lt;em>Pro tip&lt;/em>: &lt;a href="https://feelingswheel.com/">Feelings Wheel&lt;/a>)&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="q-is-it-okay-to-post-challenges-or-roadblocks-in-the-product-dailies">Q: Is it okay to post challenges or roadblocks in the &lt;em>#product-dailies&lt;/em>?&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>A: Absolutely, someone can help you after reading your update. If you think of someone in particular who could give you a hand, just tag them!&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="q-should-i-respond-to-other-team-members-updates-in-the-daily-channel">Q: Should I respond to other team members&amp;rsquo; updates in the daily channel?&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>A: If they tag you or you want to reply to something specific about their updates, it is highly encouraged to do so! You can also react to their messages with an emoji if you want to.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="q-what-sort-of-feedback-should-i-expect-on-my-updates">Q: What sort of feedback should I expect on my updates?&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>A: Managers should provide direct, regular, both positive and constructive and helpful feedback on status updates provided by the team members.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="q-i-always-forget-to-share-my-daily-updates-how-can-i-remember-to-share-them">Q: I always forget to share my daily updates. How can I remember to share them?&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>A: Tips for remembering to share the daily updates:&lt;/p>
