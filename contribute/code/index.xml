&lt;h2 id="code">Code&lt;/h2>
&lt;h3 id="writing">Writing&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Where possible, follow our &lt;a href="https://docs.communityhealthtoolkit.org/contribute/code/style-guide/">coding style guide&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Aim for self-documenting code. Where code cannot be made self-documenting add commenting. Usually comments are useful when they explain why some code exists, and should not be explaining what some code is doing.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="pushing-code--opening-pull-requests">Pushing Code &amp;amp; Opening Pull Requests&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>If your code is in a regular pull request, it is assumed to be done and only needing a review and testing as checks before merging. It is best to request a reviewer, but otherwise anyone may freely review your PR.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If your code is in a draft PR, it is assumed to be a work-in-progress where collaboration is welcome, but best to communicate about specifics before assuming anything is complete.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If you have pushed code to a remote branch without a pull request, it is assumed to be a work-in-progress where collaboration is unexpected.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>A good workflow would be to work locally, pushing to a remote branch as you make progress, possibly open a draft PR for some initial collaboration on tricky parts, and once everything is done, convert the draft PR to a regular PR to be reviewed.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="code-reviews">Code reviews&lt;/h3>
&lt;h4 id="guidelines">Guidelines&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>The author and reviewer should use this &lt;a href="https://google.github.io/eng-practices/review/developer/">guide to code reviewing&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="timeliness">Timeliness&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>Timely code reviews are important to getting improvements into the hands of users faster and allowing developers to stay focused on the task at hand and see it through to production.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Code reviews should be completed within 24 hours of assignment (excluding weekends and holidays). In some cases, a code review may not be possible if a larger discussion needs to be had for design choices or solution objectives, but even in cases like those, some feedback is still to be expected within 24 hours.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="updating-the-issue-with-what-you-actually-did">Updating The Issue With What You Actually Did&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Add &lt;a href="https://github.com/medic/cht-core/labels">labels&lt;/a> to the GitHub issue as needed. At this stage, the two to look out for are:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;code>Breaking change&lt;/code>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;code>UI/UX&lt;/code>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Add a comment to the GitHub issue with what the final change actually was. This is important for multiple cases including:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Non-technical people may not understand the conversation thread on the issue. GitHub is a place that developers work, but it is also common to send non-technical people links to issues in GitHub.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The QA team should have a quick way to know where to start testing.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Issues with a lot of discussion of alternative solutions need a clear resolution and indication of which route was taken.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Options for doing this:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Attach a short video - these are usually very well received and can often help people understand what happened much more clearly than a text description.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Screenshots - pictures with big arrows on them can quickly convey important things to look at. If you start to need multiple screenshots consider the video option instead.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Write up a few sentences - be sure to consider a non-technical audience when writing this.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>An example of a good thorough comment/template is as follows:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre tabindex="0">&lt;code>### Acceptance testing
1. Install branch `81-do-great-things`
2. [a specific thing to be sure it has been set up correctly]
3. ...
### What was actually built
[video|screenshots|text]
### Documentation
- [link](url)
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;h3 id="testing">Testing&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>All features and bug fixes must have at least one unit test. All features must have at least one end-to-end test.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The CHT has a &lt;a href="https://github.com/medic/cht-core/tree/master/tests/e2e">fully automated end-to-end testing suite&lt;/a> which is executed in CI and must pass before any change is merged. This means you can have reasonable confidence that all code merged to the main branch is safe and ready for release without further regression testing. The suite isn&amp;rsquo;t fully comprehensive but it is being constantly improved and expanded.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>From time to time Quality Assurance Engineers will perform smoke tests, scalability tests, performance tests, and penetration tests to pick up on gradual regressions that may have crept in. The ultimate goal is that these tests will eventually be automated and added to the CI suite as well.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="migrating">Migrating&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>When the schema is changed you must also provide a migration so when instances are upgraded existing data is compatible with the new code.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="commits">Commits&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The main branch is &lt;code>master&lt;/code> which must be kept stable so as not to impact other developers and so we can take a release branch as needed. To achieve this we do (almost) all development in a branch and submit a PR for code review. This means the CI runs and another developer has signed off on the change before it hits the &lt;code>master&lt;/code> branch.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Format your commit messages according to Git standards. First line should be a short title/summary (50 characters or so) with more details in a separate paragraph, respecting 79 character line widths. Using &lt;code>git commit -v&lt;/code> is recommended to review your diff while you write your commit message.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>See tips on &lt;a href="https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/">How to Write a Git Commit Message&lt;/a> and add your favorites here.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Every good commit message should be able to complete the following sentence:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When applied, this commit will: {{YOUR COMMIT MESSAGE}}&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Never force push remote. Prefer rebasing over merging as it makes for a cleaner history.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Commit reformats and refactors separately from actual code changes to make reviewing easier.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For more help with Git see: &lt;a href="https://git-scm.com/doc/ext">Using Git&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="branches">Branches&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>The main branch is &lt;code>master&lt;/code> and is the github default branch and contains the latest code.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Release branches have the form &lt;code>&amp;lt;major&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;minor&amp;gt;.x&lt;/code> and should be stable.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Feature branches have the form &lt;code>&amp;lt;issue-number&amp;gt;-&amp;lt;issue-description&amp;gt;&lt;/code> and are work in progress.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;div class="alert alert-primary" role="alert">
&lt;h4 class="alert-heading">Note&lt;/h4>
When backporting changes to an earlier release branch you should &lt;code>git cherry-pick&lt;/code> the appropriate commit(s) from &lt;code>master&lt;/code> into the release branch. Then use a pull request to make sure tests pass on CI before merging (you do not need to get the pull request approved if there were no conflicts when cherry-picking).
&lt;/div>
&lt;h2 id="issues">Issues&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Issues are managed in Github. Issues should be created in the repository where the changes need to be made. If it is not clear in which repo to open an issue the default should be the &lt;code>cht-core&lt;/code> repository. If it is a security or sensitive issue it should be opened in the private &lt;code>medic-projects&lt;/code> repository.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When creating issues add the appropriate &lt;a href="https://github.com/medic/medic/labels?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;amp;q=Priority%3A+">Priority&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://github.com/medic/medic/labels?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;amp;q=Type%3A+">Type&lt;/a> labels.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="regressions">Regressions&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>When a bug is found that impacts functionality that worked in a previous version, it&amp;rsquo;s important that these are labelled properly so someone who is planning to upgrade can find it. To flag this, add the &amp;ldquo;Regression&amp;rdquo; label, and a labels in the form &amp;ldquo;Affects: {{version}}&amp;rdquo; (e.g.: &amp;ldquo;Affects: 3.14.0&amp;rdquo;) for each version where this bug exists. It&amp;rsquo;s likely that the label for this specific version doesn&amp;rsquo;t exist so you may have to create it. This ensures that issue is listed as a Known Issue in the Release Notes for that version.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="project-states">Project States&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>When the issue is scheduled for development it will be added to the appropriate &lt;a href="https://github.com/orgs/medic/projects?query=is%3Aopen+sort%3Aname-asc">organisation project&lt;/a> named after the webapp version it will be released with. Each column in the project represents the state the issue is in.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="in-design">In design&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The issue is scheduled for release in this version but it needs some investigation, scoping, or design work before it&amp;rsquo;s ready for a developer to pick up. Issues can be picked up by product owners and designers by assigning it to themselves. Once design is complete, move the issue to &amp;ldquo;Ready for dev&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="ready-for-dev">Ready for dev&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Issues in this column have been scheduled to be released with this webapp version and are ready for development. The issue has all the detail needed to begin development and it is free for anyone to start work on. If you start work on an issue, assign it to yourself and move it to &amp;ldquo;Dev in progress&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="dev-in-progress">Dev in progress&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Issues in this column are being actively worked on, which includes development, design, and code reviews.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Any code should be in a feature branch in each of the repositories you update. The name of the feature branch should be in the form &lt;code>&amp;lt;issue-number&amp;gt;-&amp;lt;readable-name&amp;gt;&lt;/code>, for example &lt;code>1104-inclusive-export&lt;/code>. Once you&amp;rsquo;re satisfied with your changes:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Submit a PR for each of the repositories. Each PR message and description will become the commit message and description so keep the message concise, describe what and why rather than how, and link to the issue in the description (eg: &amp;ldquo;medic/cht-core#123&amp;rdquo;).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If AT is required update the issue with AT instructions.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Wait for the builds to succeed and ensure there are no conflicts with the &lt;code>master&lt;/code> branch so the PR can be merged.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Pick one Reviewer for the PR and work with them until the code passes review. In some special cases more than one Reviewer may be necessary, but be specific about additional Reviewers and ensure you really need each of their additional reviews for a good reason. Remember, anyone can always collaborate on PRs even if they aren&amp;rsquo;t an official Reviewer.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If the issue requires AT then move the issue to &amp;ldquo;Ready for AT&amp;rdquo; for QA to test. Otherwise merge the PR, delete the branch, and close the issue.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;h3 id="ready-for-at">Ready for AT&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Issues in this column are ready to be acceptance tested by a Quality Assurance engineer. When picking up an issue for AT:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Check that the PR has no merge conflicts with &lt;code>master&lt;/code> and all required builds have passed. If not, notify the original developer to fix the branch and find another issue to AT.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Assign it to yourself.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Move it to the &amp;ldquo;AT in progress&amp;rdquo; column&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;h3 id="at-in-progress">AT in progress&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Issues in this column are in the process of being acceptance tested by a Quality Assurance engineer. To complete AT:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Add or verify steps used to reproduce or execute the bug, feature, or improvement described in the ticket.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Install the PR branch to test against.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If the issue fails AT then notify the original developer and move the issue back to &amp;ldquo;Dev in progress&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Once the issue passes AT
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Document Data used. EX: Seed Data, cloned data, no data&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Document Config used or changes to existing config. Add to ticket for use later if need be.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>How was the issue verified? Console logs, page source, errors anywhere, execution steps. LGTM should begin to be rarely used.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>move the issue to &amp;ldquo;Ready to merge&amp;rdquo; the notify the original developer to merge the PR.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;h3 id="ready-to-merge">Ready to merge&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Issues in this column have passed AT and can be merged as soon as possible. The original developer will then:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Write a useful commit message in the PR.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Click the button to &amp;ldquo;Squash and Merge&amp;rdquo; the PR.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If a backport is required cherry-pick the merged commit back to the release branches it&amp;rsquo;s required in.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Close the issue. This will automatically move it to &amp;ldquo;Done&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;h3 id="done">Done&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Issues in this column have passed acceptance testing and been merged into &lt;code>master&lt;/code> and/or release branches ready for release.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Contribute: Coding Style Guide</title><link>https://docs.communityhealthtoolkit.org/contribute/code/style-guide/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://docs.communityhealthtoolkit.org/contribute/code/style-guide/</guid><description>
&lt;p>This is a guide, not a law - use your discretion. Mostly based on &lt;a href="https://github.com/felixge/node-style-guide">Felix Geisendörfer&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/a> guide with our own tweaks.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="indention">Indention&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Use 2 spaces for indenting your code and swear an oath to never mix tabs and
spaces - a special kind of hell is awaiting you otherwise.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="newlines">Newlines&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Use UNIX-style newlines (&lt;code>\n&lt;/code>), and a newline character as the last character
of a file. Windows-style newlines (&lt;code>\r\n&lt;/code>) are forbidden inside any repository.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="no-trailing-whitespace">No trailing whitespace&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Just like you brush your teeth after every meal, you clean up any trailing
whitespace in your JS files before committing. Otherwise the rotten smell of
careless neglect will eventually drive away contributors and/or co-workers.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="use-semicolons">Use Semicolons&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>According to &lt;a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1547647">scientific research&lt;/a>, the usage of semicolons is
a core value of our community. Consider the points of &lt;a href="http://blog.izs.me/post/2353458699/an-open-letter-to-javascript-leaders-regarding">the opposition&lt;/a>, but
be a traditionalist when it comes to abusing error correction mechanisms for
cheap syntactic pleasures.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="use-single-quotes">Use single quotes&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Use single quotes, unless you are writing JSON.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Right:&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="background-color:#f8f8f8;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-js" data-lang="js">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#204a87;font-weight:bold">const&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#000">foo&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#ce5c00;font-weight:bold">=&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#4e9a06">&amp;#39;bar&amp;#39;&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#000;font-weight:bold">;&lt;/span>

&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;h2 id="opening-braces-go-on-the-same-line">Opening braces go on the same line&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Your opening braces go on the same line as the statement, with whitespace before and after the condition, followed by a new line.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Crazy stuff that you will probably never need. Stay away from it.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="getters-and-setters">Getters and setters&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Do not use setters, they cause more problems for people who try to use your
software than they can solve.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Feel free to use getters that are free from &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side_effect_(computer_science)">side effects&lt;/a>, like
providing a length property for a collection class.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="npm-dependencies">NPM Dependencies&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>When picking version ranges we set an exact minimum version and an upper limit of the next major. This makes it easy to update dependencies without hitting breaking changes. In NPM this is done by using the &lt;code>^&lt;/code> character which is the default setting for NPM.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Occasionally it is required to set an exact version to avoid an undeclared breaking change or some other issue, in this case the dependency can be specified exactly.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Right:&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;code>&amp;quot;^6.5.3&amp;quot;&lt;/code> - preferred&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;code>&amp;quot;6.5.3&amp;quot;&lt;/code> - if required&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Wrong:&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;code>&amp;quot;&amp;gt;6.5.3&amp;quot;&lt;/code> - risks picking up breaking changes in the next major&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;code>&amp;quot;*&amp;quot;&lt;/code> - as above but also doesn&amp;rsquo;t specify a minimum&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;code>&amp;quot;~6.5.3&amp;quot;&lt;/code> - too restrictive on the upper limit&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;h3 id="managing-secrets">Managing Secrets&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Secrets are encrypted for use for things like passwords or API keys and can be added at the org or repository level. They must be added by an admin.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To access a secret you can use this format in your yml.&lt;/p>
&lt;pre tabindex="0">&lt;code>steps:
- name: My first action
env:
GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
FIRST_NAME: Mona
LAST_NAME: Octocat
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>See the full &lt;a href="https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/encrypted-secrets">documentation&lt;/a> on Github&amp;rsquo;s site.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="third-party-actions">Third Party Actions&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Actions allow us to leverage code written by others to do tasks at build time. The concept is similar to NPM and packages.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Follow the github actions best practices for security purposes. The main points in the security best &lt;a href="https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/security-hardening-for-github-actions#using-third-party-actions">practices documents&lt;/a> are&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Pin actions to a full length commit SHA so any malicious or buggy updates are not silently included&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Audit the source code of the action&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Pin actions to a tag only if you trust the creator&lt;/li>
