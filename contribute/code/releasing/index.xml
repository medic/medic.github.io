Feature Releases (FRs) are based on the most recent release and only include improvements related to a feature being developed. These releases are tested to be production-ready so that new features can be studied with CHT partners in a live deployment, with the aim of getting the feature ready for wider use in an upcoming release.</description></item><item><title>Publishing Docker Images</title><link>https://docs.communityhealthtoolkit.org/contribute/code/releasing/publish-docker-image/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://docs.communityhealthtoolkit.org/contribute/code/releasing/publish-docker-image/</guid><description>Docker images for CHT projects can be published to the medicmobile Docker Hub organization, so they are easily accessible to the community. This process can be automated using GitHub actions.
Create repository on Docker Hub First, create a repository for your new image on Docker Hub.
Use the admin Docker account to create a new repository in the medicmobile organization. For your new repository, update the permissions to give the developers team the ability to Read &amp;amp; Write.</description></item></channel></rss>
