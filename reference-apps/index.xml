It is a community public health tool that is designed to:
Centrally register patient cases and track contacts to prevent secondary spread of diseases in communities Create a coordinated approach to contact tracing within existing health systems Communicate the importance of self-isolation and symptom screening to exposed individuals and their families Problem Being AddressedAn essential part of containing disease outbreaks, such as COVID-19, requires public health organizations to rapidly notify people who have come into contact with confirmed or suspected patient cases.</description></item><item><title>Primary Health Care Adaptations for COVID-19</title><link>https://docs.communityhealthtoolkit.org/reference-apps/phc-covid/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://docs.communityhealthtoolkit.org/reference-apps/phc-covid/</guid><description>Primary Health Care (PHC) workflows using the CHT are easily adaptable to help communities and facilities strengthen continuity of routine primary care services during COVID-19. Adapting PHC workflows is designed to:
Address disruptions to PHC delivery within communities while keeping CHWs and patients safe Offer remote patient and CHW support through call and text-first protocols Limit physical contact between patients, CHW’s, and facility providers by modifying existing health assessments Contain transmission via embedded COVID-19 symptom screening and referral protocols Problem Being AddressedMost primary health care programs are not designed to address the specific health needs of pandemics, such as COVID-19.</description></item><item><title>COVID-19 Education and Training for CHWs</title><link>https://docs.communityhealthtoolkit.org/reference-apps/covid-education/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://docs.communityhealthtoolkit.org/reference-apps/covid-education/</guid><description>The COVID-19 pandemic has created unique challenges to providing in-person Community Health Worker training. To support CHWs, three learning modules were created to rapidly and remotely train them on COVID-19 safety protocols and patient care. Through CHT app and SMS deployments, Supervisors can now train CHWs on care workflows without being physically present. This example covers the following learning modules:
Health safety protocols for preventing the spread of COVID-19 Preventing the dissemination of misinformation about COVID-19 Recognizing COVID-19 and caring for patients with suspected infection Problem Being AddressedIt is important for Community Health Workers to stay safe and serve their communities by understanding effective health protocols for preventing the spread of COVID-19.</description></item><item><title>COVID-19 Testing with Rapid Diagnostic Tests</title><link>https://docs.communityhealthtoolkit.org/reference-apps/covid-rdt-reference-app/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://docs.communityhealthtoolkit.org/reference-apps/covid-rdt-reference-app/</guid><description>Medic has worked with FIND to build a CHT reference application for COVID-19 point-of-care testing with Rapid Diagnostic Tests (RDT). Using the reference app as an example, CHT app developers can easily include the provisioning and capture of RDT in workflows. These workflows can include third-party applications, like Dimagi&amp;rsquo;s RD-Toolkit, that guide health workers through the use of the RDT.
You can find the code for this application in the CHT Core repository on GitHub.</description></item><item><title>Direct-to-client, two-way texting workflows on CHT</title><link>https://docs.communityhealthtoolkit.org/reference-apps/direct-to-client/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://docs.communityhealthtoolkit.org/reference-apps/direct-to-client/</guid><description>This documentation provides a guide for designing and deploying direct-to-client (D2C), two-way texting (2wT) workflows to support client follow-up care using the community health toolkit (CHT). 2wT is a mobile text messaging system built on open-source, CHT tools to engage clients in their health care; to facilitate prompt client - healthcare provider interactions; to provide low-cost telehealth; and, to improve health care outcomes through the early identification of, and referral for, potential complications.</description></item><item><title>Event Based Surveillance</title><link>https://docs.communityhealthtoolkit.org/reference-apps/ebs/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://docs.communityhealthtoolkit.org/reference-apps/ebs/</guid><description>The CHT’s Event Based Surveillance (EBS) functionality enables rapid capture of information about community events that are a potential risk to public health. Deployed at the community level, this functionality is designed to:
Achieve earliest possible detection of COVID-19 cases in communities Provide visibility into signals, reports, and investigations centrally for follow-up Coordinate and support local action based on existing roles in disease surveillance Problem Being AddressedPatient reporting through traditional primary health care channels is not well suited for detecting rapidly spreading outbreaks at a community scale.</description></item><item><title>Learning and Care</title><link>https://docs.communityhealthtoolkit.org/reference-apps/learning-care/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://docs.communityhealthtoolkit.org/reference-apps/learning-care/</guid><description>The Learning &amp;amp; Care Apps in the Community Health Toolkit are designed to onboard community health workers remotely to new digital training tools, and help them learn new information and care delivery responsibilities through customized educational modules.
The modules can be deployed both (i) via the Android integration with the Academy App (powered by OppiaMobile) described in this documentation, and (ii) within the CHT core alone, to provide a seamless online &amp;amp; offline experience for CHWs, supervisors, and government partners.</description></item><item><title>Loss to Follow Up</title><link>https://docs.communityhealthtoolkit.org/reference-apps/interoperability/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://docs.communityhealthtoolkit.org/reference-apps/interoperability/</guid><description>Loss to Follow Up Workflow (LTFU)This workflow describes a use case where a health facility or a requesting system generates a list of patients who have missed follow-up appointments that were made through the CHT. A CHW would then follow up with the listed patients through SMS, a physical visit or a phone call.
Problem Being AddressedData exchange between the CHT and other systems has primarily been at peer-to-peer level. This means that the integration is built to meet the specific need in the unique scenarios.</description></item><item><title>Pharmacovigilance Reference app</title><link>https://docs.communityhealthtoolkit.org/reference-apps/pharmacovigilance-reference-app/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://docs.communityhealthtoolkit.org/reference-apps/pharmacovigilance-reference-app/</guid><description>Problem Being AddressedSelf-medication, unregulated medical products, and counterfeit drugs have led to a significant increase in the prevalence of adverse drug reactions (ADRs), adverse effects following Immunization (AEFI), and the proliferation of poor-quality health products and technologies. ADRs are a common cause of hospital admissions and contribute to patient mortality, placing a substantial economic burden on resource-limited healthcare systems, especially in African countries.
Need for Pharmacovigilance: Pharmacovigilance focuses on the detection, assessment, understanding and prevention of adverse effects and other potential drug-related problems.</description></item><item><title>YendaNafe CHT app by PIH in Malawi</title><link>https://docs.communityhealthtoolkit.org/reference-apps/pih/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://docs.communityhealthtoolkit.org/reference-apps/pih/</guid><description>Since 2017, Partners in Health (PIH) Malawi and Medic have collaboratively co-designed and developed YendaNafe, a digital health app for community based service provision.
