Scope. Clear definition of the challenge, duration of implementation, implementation deliverables, and the change expected as a result of implementation. Technical requirements. Infrastructure (servers - physical/ cloud) and hardware (devices such as smartphones/tablets, laptops/computers) requirements. Context. General understanding of the geography (country/region) in the following domains; legal and policy landscape, infrastructure penetration e.g. mobile and electricity connectivity, community health setup and maturity e.</description></item><item><title>Prerequisites for App Development</title><link>https://docs.communityhealthtoolkit.org/building/prerequisites/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://docs.communityhealthtoolkit.org/building/prerequisites/</guid><description>There are no set prerequisites for users of CHT apps, yet the following are helpful for developing CHT applications.
Test InstanceTo build your own application using the Core Framework you will need an instance set up for testing. You can set up a local instance by following these instructions.
Build toolThe build tool for applications using the Core Framework is cht-conf. To set it up, follow the installation instructions. To properly use the tool you will need your application files in set locations within a folder.</description></item><item><title>Getting started building a CHT app</title><link>https://docs.communityhealthtoolkit.org/building/local-setup/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://docs.communityhealthtoolkit.org/building/local-setup/</guid><description>This tutorial will take you through setting up a local environment to build and test CHT applications on CHT version 4.x. This includes setting up the necessary tools to download and run the CHT public docker image as well as a command line interface tool to manage and build CHT apps.
By the end of the tutorial you should be able to:
View the login page to CHT webapp on localhost Upload default settings to localhost Note This guide will only work with CHT 4.</description></item><item><title>Condition Cards</title><link>https://docs.communityhealthtoolkit.org/building/condition-cards/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://docs.communityhealthtoolkit.org/building/condition-cards/</guid><description>This tutorial will take you through building a condition card for CHT applications.
Condition cards, like contact summaries display information about the contact. The data displayed in condition cards can be pulled from submitted reports.
In this tutorial,you will be adding a condition card that displays information about a person&amp;rsquo;s most recent assessment, including: the date of the most recent assessment, and whether or not they had a cough.</description></item></channel></rss>
