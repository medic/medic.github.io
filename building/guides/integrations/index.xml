You can see more details of the tool here. The following FHIR resources are supported:
Sending Patient data from the CHT to interoperating systems. Sending reports as Encounters with Observations from the CHT to interoperating systems. Sending Patient data created in interoperating systems to CHT applications. Sending health information represented as Encounters with Observations from interoperating systems to CHT applications. Sending DataWhen sending data to an interoperating system, we use outbound push to configure which documents should be sent and at what point.</description></item><item><title>DHIS2 Aggregate</title><link>https://docs.communityhealthtoolkit.org/building/guides/integrations/dhis2-aggregate/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://docs.communityhealthtoolkit.org/building/guides/integrations/dhis2-aggregate/</guid><description>One of the first things you’ll need to do is identify the specific DHIS2 data set that you plan to implement. You’ll need a list of all the data elements on that data set, a detailed understanding of how each is calculated, the frequency in which the data set is submitted (weekly, monthly, etc…), and for which organisation units the data set applies. You’ll also want to identify and engage the appropriate DHIS2 stakeholders to get access to DHIS2 metadata, test environments, and discuss workflows.</description></item><item><title>OpenMRS</title><link>https://docs.communityhealthtoolkit.org/building/guides/integrations/openmrs/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://docs.communityhealthtoolkit.org/building/guides/integrations/openmrs/</guid><description>OpenMRS is an open source electronic medical record system used in dozens of countries. Integrating CHT apps with OpenMRS can open up opportunities to improve health outcomes for patients by promoting better coordination of care. For example, referrals by CHWs in the community can be sent electronically to health facilities using OpenMRS so that nurses and clinicians can prepare for their visit and have full access to the assessment done by a CHW.</description></item><item><title>OppiaMobile</title><link>https://docs.communityhealthtoolkit.org/building/guides/integrations/oppia/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://docs.communityhealthtoolkit.org/building/guides/integrations/oppia/</guid><description>The training modules configuration consists of five main components:
App Forms - Content that the user will interact with; Tasks - How forms are presented to the user: how and when the user accesses the forms for input; Targets - Shows the progress of the user; Contact Summary - Gives a highlight of the modules completed by the user; Context - Defines what forms are available to fill from the user’s profile, or available as tasks.</description></item><item><title>RapidPro</title><link>https://docs.communityhealthtoolkit.org/building/guides/integrations/rapidpro/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://docs.communityhealthtoolkit.org/building/guides/integrations/rapidpro/</guid><description>RapidPro is the open-source platform that powers TextIt, developed by UNICEF and Nyaruka. RapidPro allows you to visually build messaging workflows for mobile-based services. Review RapidPro’s documentation to familiarize yourself with various components that include the API. Before you embark on designing an integrated RapidPro/CHT workflow, you should start by understanding the needs of your users, identifying a problem to solve, and establishing goals. While an integrated RapidPro/CHT workflow can open up many powerful and personalized messaging capabilities, introducing an additional technology solution does come with complexities and cost.</description></item></channel></rss>
