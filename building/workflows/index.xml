Forms are the main building block of tasks and messaging workflows, and are useful in creating reminders for follow-up visits or referrals.
TasksTasks within the app can drive a workflow, ensuring that the right actions are taken for people at the right time. Tasks indicate a recommended action to the user. They indicate who the user should perform the action with, and the recommended timeframe of that action.</description></item><item><title>Configurable Hierarchies</title><link>https://docs.communityhealthtoolkit.org/building/workflows/hierarchy/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://docs.communityhealthtoolkit.org/building/workflows/hierarchy/</guid><description>The Core Framework requires a hierarchy to organize the information in the app. It is often based on the hierarchy of a health system within a particular geographic region.
Large deployment sites often need three or more levels of place hierarchy, while some small sites need fewer than three levels. For this reason, the Core Frameworkâ€™s information hierarchies are configurable to meet a users needs.
A user logging into their app will see a custom set of people, tasks, reports, and analytics based on the hierarchy level that they belong to.</description></item><item><title>Muting</title><link>https://docs.communityhealthtoolkit.org/building/workflows/muting/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://docs.communityhealthtoolkit.org/building/workflows/muting/</guid><description>Muting is a way for CHWs to temporarily silence notifications about Contacts (people and places) and is commonly used when a person or family has temporarily relocated or refused services. When a Contact is muted, they will appear differently on the People tab and CHWs will no longer receive tasks or SMS about them.
To start receiving notifications about a Contact again, CHWs can unmute them. When a Contact is unmuted, tasks and SMS schedules will resume, but notifications that would have been sent while they were muted will not.</description></item><item><title>Death Reporting</title><link>https://docs.communityhealthtoolkit.org/building/workflows/death-reporting/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://docs.communityhealthtoolkit.org/building/workflows/death-reporting/</guid><description>In this section you will learn how to set up a death report workflow.
