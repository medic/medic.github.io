For reliability an SMS Aggregator, such as Africa&amp;rsquo;s Talking or RapidPro, is recommended. When an SMS Aggregator is not available, an Android device running CHT Gateway can be used to send and receive SMS in your CHT application. You may use an existing Android device and are not required to purchase a new one. However, for more reliable sending and receiving of SMS, the Android device should be in your organizationâ€™s office or facility with a consistent internet connection.</description></item><item><title>Troubleshooting</title><link>https://docs.communityhealthtoolkit.org/building/messaging/gateways/gateway/troubleshooting/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://docs.communityhealthtoolkit.org/building/messaging/gateways/gateway/troubleshooting/</guid><description>In a techlead heaven, we would have immediate physical access to gateway phones, but alas, most of the time we have to hand them over to the partner.
