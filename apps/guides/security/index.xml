Implementers need to know when ease of use is more important than a more secure system. By reading this document you should be able to know when to make the &amp;ldquo;more secure&amp;rdquo; vs &amp;ldquo;easier to use&amp;rdquo; trade off.
No system is perfectly secure - be prepared to remediate a security breach!

PIN Setup and FDEInstructions are slightly different per device. Enabling FDE has the added benefit that you must also lock the device with a pin code or password.
