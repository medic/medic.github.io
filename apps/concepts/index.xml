Hardware &amp;amp; Software Requirements Hardware procurement, ownership, and management is the responsibility of each implementing organization. We strongly urge all organizations to procure hardware locally to ensure ease of replacement, repair, sustainability, and hardware support when needed.
Accessing on Desktop On desktop devices, there is no need to download anything.</description></item><item><title>Navigating CHT Apps</title><link>https://docs.communityhealthtoolkit.org/apps/concepts/navigation/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://docs.communityhealthtoolkit.org/apps/concepts/navigation/</guid><description>Summary of Page Tabs Page tabs are the primary way to navigate apps built with the Core Framework. The number of tabs is variable depending on the user’s role and place in the hierarchy. For example, non-admin users don’t have Messages. The Reports tab is accessible to CHWs but often located inside the secondary menu drawer.
Messages​: A place for community-based staff to send and exchange messages Tasks​: This is a list of upcoming visits, follow-ups, or other required tasks Reports​: A detailed history of all forms submitted by CHWs and other staff People​: This is where profiles of districts, staff, CHWs and patients live Targets: Displays real-time visualizations of key activity and impact indicators The Menu Drawer Tap the menu icon in the upper right corner of the header to access other pages, edit personal settings, view sync status and more.</description></item><item><title>Forms</title><link>https://docs.communityhealthtoolkit.org/apps/concepts/forms/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://docs.communityhealthtoolkit.org/apps/concepts/forms/</guid><description>Forms are a building block of all CHT apps. They are used when creating or editing contacts, and when completing a care guide or survey within the app. Forms are also used to interpret SMS interactions with the CHT.
When a completed form is submitted, it is treated as a Report in the app. All reports can be viewed in the Reports tab by those with the proper access within the hierarchy.</description></item><item><title>Care Guides</title><link>https://docs.communityhealthtoolkit.org/apps/concepts/care-guides/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://docs.communityhealthtoolkit.org/apps/concepts/care-guides/</guid><description>Care Guides Forms are used to build “Care Guides” that take health workers through care protocols and provide decision support for their interactions with patients. App designers can use the basic form building functionality in a variety of ways.
Care Guides also allow CHWs to register new families and people, assess a sick child, and enroll a new pregnancy into an antenatal care schedule. Care Guides can be located in many parts of your app, including the Tasks, People, and Reports tabs.</description></item><item><title>Building Workflows</title><link>https://docs.communityhealthtoolkit.org/apps/concepts/workflows/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://docs.communityhealthtoolkit.org/apps/concepts/workflows/</guid><description>Workflows can be defined within apps built with the Core Framework to connect actions and data with people. Forms are the main building block of tasks and messaging workflows, and are useful in creating reminders for follow-up visits or referrals.
Tasks Tasks within the app can drive a workflow, ensuring that the right actions are taken for people at the right time. Tasks indicate a recommended action to the user. They indicate who the user should perform the action with, and the recommended timeframe of that action.</description></item><item><title>Configurable Hierarchies</title><link>https://docs.communityhealthtoolkit.org/apps/concepts/hierarchy/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://docs.communityhealthtoolkit.org/apps/concepts/hierarchy/</guid><description>The Core Framework requires a hierarchy to organize the information in the app. It is often based on the hierarchy of a health system within a particular geographic region.
Large deployment sites often need three or more levels of place hierarchy, while some small sites need fewer than three levels. For this reason, the Core Framework’s information hierarchies are configurable to meet a users needs.
A user logging into their app will see a custom set of people, tasks, reports, and analytics based on the hierarchy level that they belong to.</description></item><item><title>Users</title><link>https://docs.communityhealthtoolkit.org/apps/concepts/users/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://docs.communityhealthtoolkit.org/apps/concepts/users/</guid><description>Apps built with the Core Framework use roles and permissions to determine who has access to what data. User roles are general categories you can use to assign a collection of broad permissions to users. There are two classes of roles: online and offline. Generally speaking, CHWs are usually offline users, while managers and nurses are usually online users. SMS users do not use the app, and thus do not have a user role.</description></item><item><title>Interoperability</title><link>https://docs.communityhealthtoolkit.org/apps/concepts/interoperability/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://docs.communityhealthtoolkit.org/apps/concepts/interoperability/</guid><description>Introduction Interoperability refers to the ability of different health information systems and applications to communicate with each other and exchange data seamlessly. With interoperability, patient information can be seen, exchanged, and used across different platforms. The information/data exchanged has to be understood across the different software for these systems to become interoperable. This is different from integration which requires custom development to connect two specific systems together.
Interoperability is the best practice for health systems because it allows information from one system to be shared with one or more other systems with no additional development.</description></item><item><title>Prerequisites for App Development</title><link>https://docs.communityhealthtoolkit.org/apps/concepts/prerequisites/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://docs.communityhealthtoolkit.org/apps/concepts/prerequisites/</guid><description>There are no set prerequisites for users of CHT apps, yet the following are helpful for developing CHT applications.
Test Instance To build your own application using the Core Framework you will need an instance set up for testing. You can set up a local instance by following these instructions.
Build tool The build tool for applications using the Core Framework is cht-conf. To set it up, follow the installation instructions.</description></item></channel></rss>
