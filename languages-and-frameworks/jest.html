It is designed to be easy to use and provides a comprehensive set of tools for writing end-to-end, integration, and unit tests for JavaScript applications. 
It is a complete and ready to set up JavaScript testing solution.</p>
<p>In the CHT, Jest is used to test <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/medic/cht-interoperability">cht-interoperability</a>.</p>
<h3 id="advantages">Advantages</h3>
<ul>
<li>Easy to use: Jest is intuitive and easy to set up, making it ideal for beginners and experienced developers.</li>
<li>Extensive test coverage: Jest provides a complete set of tools for writing unit, integration, and end-to-end tests.</li>
<li>Integration with other frameworks: Jest integrates well with projects that use React, but can also be used with other JavaScript frameworks (​​Babel, TypeScript, Node, React, Angular, Vue and more).</li>
<li>Fast and efficient: Jest uses parallel test execution and other techniques to speed up test execution time.</li>
<li>Provides testing support for asynchronous code.</li>
<li>It is maintained and well-documented, making it easy to learn.</li>
<li>Code Coverage: Jest provides built-in code coverage reports to help developers identify areas not covered by tests.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="drawbacks">Drawbacks</h3>
<ul>
<li>Compared to Jasmine and other frameworks, not many libraries and toolings are supported by Jest.</li>
<li>People not comfortable with the Jest framework have asserted that the learning curve is pretty hard.</li>
<li>Leveraging auto-mocking can make tests slow. This is because the more dependencies a module has, the more work needs to be done by Jest to mock it, which comes at the cost of performance.</li>
<li>Snapshot testing with Jest is not so feasible for larger snapshot files containing thousands of lines.</li>
<li>Its debugging capabilities need improvement.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="market---current-adoption">Market - Current Adoption</h2>
<p>Jest has over 10 million <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/jestjs/jest/network/dependents">dependent repos on GitHub</a>.
Prominent companies that reportedly adopt Jest in their tech stack are: Facebook, Airbnb, Spotify, The New York Times, Travel Perk, Twitter, Instagram, etc.
