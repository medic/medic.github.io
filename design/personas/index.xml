&lt;h2 id="a-day-in-the-life">A Day in the Life&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Janet is a CHW who has been working for BRAC for 2 years. She lives in Bembe Central, a periurban town. She visits 10 and 15 homes daily where many of the families live in brick/clay huts reinforced with straw with no electricity, running water or internet connection.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Janet visits homes based off a list after she finishes her day job. There is no particular order, although she follows the register. While she may get some specific calls, most days she just visits homes and records her visits in the book. Some visits can be as quick as 2 minutes. She walks along a dirt road with her BRAC outfit making her stand out. She often calls out to her neighbors as she walks alon the road. In the rainy season — when diarrhea is often worse — these roads flood. Janet does not visit homes on these days.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>During her visits Janet carries her register, an education booklet, drugs and other sales material in her bag which is very heavy. She readjusts the weight of her bag several times and sometimes drops her drugs. Bodas play an important role in the health system here. Janet has a trusted body driver, whom she asks to deliver drugs.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On days with her Supervisor, Janet might visit 20-25 homes. The Supervisor joins her at least once a month where they also conduct “health forums” together. Supervisors conduct technical procedures,such as taking BP, marking columns in the CHWs register and later copies this into their own during refresher trainings.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A normal day lasts about 2 hours.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Design: CHW Supervisor, Ann</title><link>https://docs.communityhealthtoolkit.org/design/personas/chw-supervisor-ann/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://docs.communityhealthtoolkit.org/design/personas/chw-supervisor-ann/</guid><description>

&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="a-day-in-the-life">A Day in the Life&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Ann wakes up early in the morning to prepare her son for school and husband for work. She takes her son to school which is on her way to health center where she is based.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>She needs to be at the health center by 9 am so she takes a bus for part of the journey and a motorbike for the rest of the journey. The health center is located about 10 km from her home.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>She attends to her public health officer’s duties based at the health center. She is primarily in charge of the community and market sanitation, so she facilitates the small scale traders who run business at the nearby market to get health check-ups that are mandatory before she issues them a certified health certificate that allows them to run food related businesses in the market.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the course of her day, she collaborates with a wide range of stakeholders in order to perform her chores. She liaises with the clinicians and nurses to identify defaulters of care in order to organize for the follows up through the community health workers. The nurse would give her a list of children who have missed their vaccine appointments, the pregnant women who have missed their antenatal care clinics, the Tuberculosis and HIV/AIDs clinicians also have a list of defaulters of care that should be followed to ensure prompt care. She must liaises with the CHWs to be trace these patients and reintroduce them to care. This is one of her greatest challenge as it is hard to trace the children in the wide facility catchment area. You know it is her responsibility to ensure that the community health workers are creating demand for the health services at the community level and ensuring that the community members access the quality care at the health facilities. She assesses the performance of her CHWs by looking at how many community members they refer to the health facilities for care, and the adherence to care of the patients referred by each CHW. This is no mean easy task as CHWs are not paid and the villages they cover are wide and a very hilly terrain which becomes impossible during the rainy weather. Over half of the CHWs that she trained during the initiation of the CHW program in her area three years have dropped, and the new ones she has replaced need to be trained on the whole package of their role. She would gladly do this but “Oh, when will an non governmental organization come by to support us in this capacity building activity?” She exclaims. Meanwhile she must support the new CHWs by accompanying them at least once a month when they are doing their household visits in the villages.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Since there is an upcoming community based polio and tetanus campaign targeted for under-fives and women of reproductive health, she must select and contact several CHWs from each village that will help them administer these vaccines in their villages and therefore reach the most possible target population.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>She must also liaise with the area administrative chief who provide the go ahead of the community based activities to mobilize the community for health education and dialogue days and community health related activities. She and her CHWs lead the community to discuss on various disease preventive and health promotive activities that are tailored to meet health needs/gaps they have observed within the community. They use these regular forums to reinforce important health messages like the importance pregnant women going for ANC and children for immunization. She leads the community health workers and community members during community action days.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>She also works hand in hand with the schools heads for deworming and Vitamin A campaign targeted at children, a regular activity which she carries out with the CHWs.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ann’s 80% of her time is spent interacting with the community and the community health workers. This month’s monthly meeting with the CHWs is early next week. She must make some time to prepare some notes on how to make drinking water safe for use in the community, during a visit in the community, she observed that the community was using unsafe water for drinking and the CHW did not know what to advise her households to make the water safe. The CHEW continues to offer need based training to the CHWs depending on assessment of the knowledge deficits of the CHWs after the initial training. He guides the CHWs, on how to effectively communicate well with the community. She intents to guide the CHWs on the data items to collect as most of them have not been sending all the reports as required. If transport within the community was cheap or easier she would visit the CHWs who did not send reports and or those who send inaccurate data or incomplete reports and walk with them as they collect the data.. As a CHEW, she is charged by the MOH to aggregate data about the community’s state of health that is received from the CHWs on a monthly basis. The primary data items for her reflect the utilization of health services by the community.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ann has a regular end of month meeting with her community health supervisor who is based in the Sub district hospital that is 150km away from her station early in the morning on Wednesday. She must prepare and present her monthly written reports and give a verbal report of the state of the community and performance of the CHWs under her supervision.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ann gets back to her home at 6 pm, she picks her son from school where he had been playing since 4pm when the other pupils leave school for home. She prepares supper for her family, and carries out the other family chores. She retires to bed at about 10pm tired but happy to have accomplished her day’s duties.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Design: Regional Manager, Christina</title><link>https://docs.communityhealthtoolkit.org/design/personas/regional-manager-christina/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://docs.communityhealthtoolkit.org/design/personas/regional-manager-christina/</guid><description>

&lt;br>
&lt;h2 id="about">About&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Mary has formal clinical training but a limited ability to conduct complex surgical procedures. She sees +/- 50 patients a day, sometimes in their homes. She is literate in English and understands local dialects. She is sometimes stationed far from her rural town/family in spurts and makes regular trips to districts to hand-deliver reports.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Mary lives on $5/day and depends mostly on solar power at the clinic as she may not have electricity at home. She is enthusiastic about technology but has had little exposure. She has an email address that she does not check regularly and has a basic understanding of Windows OS. She uses Facebook and M-PESA on a low-end phone.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="values">Values&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Good health. Anyone is only able to work and therefore take care of ones and other people’s needs if and when in really good health&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Family is the essence of one’s existence and that each child is entitled to love that can be best provided and experienced in the family setting&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Education is the ticket for better, healthier and happier life for everyone&lt;/li>

&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Nurse Mary wants nil (zero) maternal and child mortalities in the community served by the health facility&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Nurse Mary needs all the community to be aware of the health care services that they can access at the health facility&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Nurse Mary needs everyone in the community to have access and adhere to continuous quality care provided at the health facility&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Nurse Mary needs all defaulters to health care available at the health facility that are in the community to be traced and re-introduced to care&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Nurse Mary needs to keep and get accurate data of the target population that she provides health care for&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Nurse Mary needs to keep abreast with new editions of nursing procedures through regular trainings/seminars&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="motivations">Motivations&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Community enjoying services of skilled health professionals for deliveries which translates to no or very few maternal and child mortalities. More money for her to run the facility as finances for performance is a policy that is in use now in Kenya.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Healthier children, with fewer neonatal, infant or child mortalities, and 100% full immunization of all under-fives.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Progress within the nursing profession with continues and recognized certifications.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Model health facility where other health facilities are encouraged to emulate and adopt those standards.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Prompt report submissions to supervisors and the recognition by the supervisors for that.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="strengths-and-assets">Strengths and Assets&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>

&lt;li>Mobile phones: smart phones, facebook, Whatsapp and access to email&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Computer literacy: access email, basic understanding of the windows OS&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Access to either solar or electricity power at the health center&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="a-day-in-the-life">A Day in the Life&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Her day at work starts early as she must be on duty at 7 am, to relieve the nurse who has been on cover of the health facility at night if she is in a health facility that as at least 2 of them. In the health facility, where she is the only nurse she comes to pick up from where she left last evening, if she was “lucky” not to be woken up to attend to a patient at night.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>She gets a report from the “night nurse” of all the in-patients-mainly women in labor, newborns born at night, children less than 5 years brought in at night for care and injuries resulting from accidents.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>8am going to 9am, the outpatient is swollen with patients: mothers with under five children bringing them to the child welfare clinic, pregnant women some with under five children coming also for antenatal care, and elderly women and men, all weak, sick looking and would pass for nutritional support-if only there were supplements for the elderly. The ones in store are for the under 5 malnourished and pregnant women.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Anyway, she notes the need to do a health education session on how to eat a well-nourished meal using the locally available food stuffs, but now, she must do one on how to prevent contracting cholera as cholera as for the last 2 months being reported in many parts of the country. It is a regular practice to carry out health education sessions to the out patients. She will also talk to the CHEW today for a health education session with the CHWs during their monthly meeting on cholera prevention that the CHWs must disseminate to the community. She and the field CHEW must liaise consistently as they work together with the CHWs to promote the health of the community. Her role is to oversee the field CHEW and to help her meet the knowledge gap of the CHWs by consistently teaching CHWs on common local diseases and how to prevent them, identifying them, giving first aid and referring patients for specialized health care.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The CHWs are critical to her as they are the link between the community and the health facility that is very important. The CHWs help her trace the children under five lost to follow up, malnourished children in the community who need follow up, chronically ill patients in the community that need home based care and refer and support orphans and vulnerable children in the community. The field CHEW co-ordinates this activity, after giving her the list of the patients to be followed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Her next in line activity is to see the ANC mothers, she co-ordinates their care, sends them for laboratory work, prescribe treatments and supplements based to the general health assessments of the woman and the lab results. She records care given in the maternal child booklet, and advises her on when to come for her next follow up. She briefly counsels on how to take care of herself during pregnancy, feed well and the exercises to take, maintain good hygiene and to plan to deliver her baby in the health facility: the individual birth plan, must be reinforced by the CHWs who can afford some more time for a one to one talk with the woman. She keeps a record of all the pregnant women she sees, both the new and those that come for subsequent visit. She will write a report based on this at the end of the month showing the new pregnancies, those that have it 4+ANC visits, new PMTC cases among other details.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>She will also attend to the under-fives, both those that have come for the routine immunization and growth monitoring and the sick ones who were brought for treatment. She will record all the care given in the mother child booklet and give brief advice on nutrition of the child while charting the weight on the growth monitoring chart. She will attend to the other sickly patients as well, give family planning counseling and services, and monitor the mothers in labor in the ward. Among other duties that she must attend to are emergency cases referred from the community, accompanying complicated cases to the higher level hospital for more specialized care, and assisting the doctors and clinicians in handling special cases when in facility like a hospital where these services are offered.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The day has not started or ended if she has not read the temperature of the thermometers of the vaccine boxes to ensure that it is in the required temperature ranges and therefore the boxes are in good order.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Her monthly reports range from daily vaccine monitoring chart, to the ANC, immunization related records to the vaccine usage rates for the month. She places monthly based order for vaccine supplies based on the month’s usage, and must collect the vaccines from the sub-county headquarters before the end of the first week of the month. She attends a monthly visit organized by her supervisors at the sub-county district, at least monthly and frequently meets her colleagues during the irregular continuous education seminars organized by their supervisors.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Nurse Mary faces a lot of challenges, but the most pressing is the workload coupled with the intensity of the nature of the work that she faces day in, day out. She is entitled to work a maximum of 45 hours a week, but is that really what happens?&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Design: Data Manager, Paul</title><link>https://docs.communityhealthtoolkit.org/design/personas/data-manager-paul/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://docs.communityhealthtoolkit.org/design/personas/data-manager-paul/</guid><description>
