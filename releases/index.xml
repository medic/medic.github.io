If you are validating incoming patient_ids in Sentinel, be sure to remove or correct any length restrictions, e.g. ^[0-9]{5}$ would become ^[0-9]{5,13}$. #3166 adds a new transition that adds patient_ids to every created person: generate_patient_id_on_people.

The contact parameter no longer has information about parents. This information is now in an array called lineage. More information is available in the configuration documentation. #3546 changes the implementation of the contact_summary so instead of declaring the output on the last line of the script, now you have to return the output. Usually this is as easy as adding a return on the last line, so output; becomes return output;.</description></item><item><title>2.13.1 release notes</title><link>https://docs.communityhealthtoolkit.org/releases/2.13.1/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://docs.communityhealthtoolkit.org/releases/2.13.1/</guid><description>Bug fixes Fix bug in extract-person-contacts migration introduced in 2.13.0 #4031 Remove the now invalid erlang migrations #4033</description></item><item><title>2.13.2 release notes</title><link>https://docs.communityhealthtoolkit.org/releases/2.13.2/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://docs.communityhealthtoolkit.org/releases/2.13.2/</guid><description>Bug fixes Force outputs to recalc on form load #4111</description></item><item><title>2.13.3 release notes</title><link>https://docs.communityhealthtoolkit.org/releases/2.13.3/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://docs.communityhealthtoolkit.org/releases/2.13.3/</guid><description>Improvements Bump libphonenumber to the latest</description></item><item><title>2.13.4 release notes</title><link>https://docs.communityhealthtoolkit.org/releases/2.13.4/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://docs.communityhealthtoolkit.org/releases/2.13.4/</guid><description>Improvements Bump libphonenumber for Nepal Smart Telecom.</description></item><item><title>2.13.5 release notes</title><link>https://docs.communityhealthtoolkit.org/releases/2.13.5/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://docs.communityhealthtoolkit.org/releases/2.13.5/</guid><description>Bug fixes Update Notification transition crashes sentinel if the patient id is misconfigured. #4121</description></item><item><title>2.13.6 release notes</title><link>https://docs.communityhealthtoolkit.org/releases/2.13.6/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://docs.communityhealthtoolkit.org/releases/2.13.6/</guid><description>Performance improvements Drastically improve performance of form loading when the patient context is used, and that context is very large (e.g. you&amp;rsquo;re including lineages). #4430</description></item><item><title>2.13.7 release notes</title><link>https://docs.communityhealthtoolkit.org/releases/2.13.7/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://docs.communityhealthtoolkit.org/releases/2.13.7/</guid><description>Performance improvements Various PouchDB performance improvements were backported from 2.14.

Migration notes #3449: We included a feature which makes it unnecessary to use a repeat-relevant node in Enketo forms to workaround a bug which created an empty child. This node should now be removed. #3629: We added more configurable text to the target widgets. Also, configuring an array of target titles is now deprecated in favor specifying a single translation key. Reconfigure your targets to specify values for translation_key, subtitle_translation_key, and percentage_count_translation_key properties.</description></item><item><title>2.14.1 release notes</title><link>https://docs.communityhealthtoolkit.org/releases/2.14.1/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://docs.communityhealthtoolkit.org/releases/2.14.1/</guid><description>Performance improvements #4430: Drastically improve performance of form loading when the patient context is used, and that context is very large (e.g. you&amp;rsquo;re including lineages).</description></item><item><title>2.14.2 release notes</title><link>https://docs.communityhealthtoolkit.org/releases/2.14.2/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://docs.communityhealthtoolkit.org/releases/2.14.2/</guid><description>Bug fixes #3099: Uncaught exception triggers 500 response for subsequent requests.</description></item><item><title>2.14.3 release notes</title><link>https://docs.communityhealthtoolkit.org/releases/2.14.3/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://docs.communityhealthtoolkit.org/releases/2.14.3/</guid><description>Bug fixes #4457: The z-score enketo widget is not usable. #4460: Uncaught Exception: write after end error.</description></item><item><title>2.15.0 release notes</title><link>https://docs.communityhealthtoolkit.org/releases/2.15.0/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://docs.communityhealthtoolkit.org/releases/2.15.0/</guid><description>What&amp;rsquo;s NewView &amp;lsquo;clinic&amp;rsquo; Places in Places FilterYou might have noticed that for SMS projects, CHW areas went missing from the places filter in the Reports tab. Good news! They are back.
When we started having CHWs log into the Medic app and register families, the places filter on the reports page became crowded with thousands of families, creating a performance issue. To get around that issue, we removed 'clinic' level places from this filter drop-down so that users would only see health centers and CHW areas, no families.</description></item><item><title>2.16.0 release notes</title><link>https://docs.communityhealthtoolkit.org/releases/2.16.0/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://docs.communityhealthtoolkit.org/releases/2.16.0/</guid><description>What&amp;rsquo;s NewView date last visited for places on the people tabBecause knowing where you&amp;rsquo;ve been helps you know where you&amp;rsquo;re going next! - Medic proverb
In order to help CHWs achieve full coverage of every family or household they care for, we&amp;rsquo;ve added an optional feature to update the list of families or areas to display the date that family or area was last visited. You can use any patient- or family-level form or forms to update the date last visited.</description></item><item><title>2.16.1 release notes</title><link>https://docs.communityhealthtoolkit.org/releases/2.16.1/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://docs.communityhealthtoolkit.org/releases/2.16.1/</guid><description>What&amp;rsquo;s NewShow an icon next to families or areas that are overdue for a visitAs the ICONic Britney Spears once sang, &amp;ldquo;Show me a siiiiiign… [visit] me, baby, one more time!&amp;rdquo;
In order to help CHWs achieve full coverage of every family or household they care for, we added a feature in 2.16 to update the list of families or areas to display the date that family or area was last visited.</description></item><item><title>2.17.0 release notes</title><link>https://docs.communityhealthtoolkit.org/releases/2.17.0/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://docs.communityhealthtoolkit.org/releases/2.17.0/</guid><description>What&amp;rsquo;s NewShow pictures in the report view (History tab)Your selfies are safe with us (and now visible in the Reports tab).
Photos uploaded by CHWs are now visible in the Reports view, or History tab. This is currently being used in the mRDT workflow by supervisors to confirm that CHWs read the mRDT test results correctly. [#4742]

We&amp;rsquo;ve now made the default sort configurable. For UHC mode, this would likely mean sorting by last visited date. In the future, it could include sorting by number of visits this month or another value.
To enable default contact sorting to be based on last visited date, you need to configure it in app_settings.</description></item><item><title>2.18.1 release notes</title><link>https://docs.communityhealthtoolkit.org/releases/2.18.1/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://docs.communityhealthtoolkit.org/releases/2.18.1/</guid><description>What&amp;rsquo;s NewCount two visits on the same day as one visitIf a family is visited twice on the same day it now only counts as one visit in UHC mode.
