For data synchronization, refer to CHT Sync.
Create read-only replicas of CouchDB data inside PostgresSQL.
The focus is specifically on CHT application data currently stored in CouchDB. If you are looking to have a read-only replica of CouchDB data for your application that isn&amp;rsquo;t the CHT, consider couch2pg.
This version is built for medic/cht-core#3.0.0 and above. For replicating data from earlier versions, see the 2.0.x branch and associated tags.</description></item><item><title>Migration</title><link>https://docs.communityhealthtoolkit.org/hosting/couch2pg/migration/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://docs.communityhealthtoolkit.org/hosting/couch2pg/migration/</guid><description>CHT couch2pg is deprecated.

Assumptions &amp;amp; PrerequisitesThis guide assumes:
Your CHT instance set up. Your Postgres server is set up. We&amp;rsquo;ll be using 10.195.130.93 in this documentation, but be sure to use your production Postgres address. The server needs to have pg_dump command available. Your CHT couch2pg (aka couch2pg) instance is set up. In this guide, we&amp;rsquo;ll assume it&amp;rsquo;s on the same server as the Postgres instance.</description></item></channel></rss>
