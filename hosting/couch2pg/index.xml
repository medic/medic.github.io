Create read-only replicas of CouchDB data inside PostgresSQL.
The focus is specifically on CHT application data currently stored in CouchDB. If you are looking to have a read-only replica of CouchDB data for your application that isn&amp;rsquo;t the CHT, consider couch2pg.
This version is built for medic/cht-core#3.0.0 and above. For replicating data from earlier versions, see the 2.0.x branch and associated tags.</description></item><item><title>Migration</title><link>https://docs.communityhealthtoolkit.org/hosting/couch2pg/migration/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://docs.communityhealthtoolkit.org/hosting/couch2pg/migration/</guid><description>couch2pg is deprecated.

Assumptions &amp;amp; PrerequisitesThis guide assumes:
Your CHT instance set up. Your Postgres server is set up. We&amp;rsquo;ll be using 10.195.130.93 in this documentation, but be sure to use your production Postgres address. The server needs to have pg_dump command available. Your CHT couch2pg (aka couch2pg) instance is set up. In this guide, we&amp;rsquo;ll assume it&amp;rsquo;s on the same server as the Postgres instance.</description></item><item><title>Local couch2pg Setup</title><link>https://docs.communityhealthtoolkit.org/hosting/couch2pg/couch2pg-setup/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://docs.communityhealthtoolkit.org/hosting/couch2pg/couch2pg-setup/</guid><description>CHT couch2pg is deprecated. For data synchronization, refer to CHT Sync.
This tutorial will take you through setting up a couch2pg service.
By the end of the tutorial you should be able to:
Set up a couch2pg service Run the couch2pg service CHT Couch2pg is a background process that moves data from Couchdb to Postgres through one way replication. It therefore, needs to have full read and write access to both the Postgres Database and Couchdb upstream.</description></item><item><title>Fixing couch2pg Memory Errors</title><link>https://docs.communityhealthtoolkit.org/hosting/couch2pg/couch2pg-oom-errors/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://docs.communityhealthtoolkit.org/hosting/couch2pg/couch2pg-oom-errors/</guid><description>CHT couch2pg is deprecated. For data synchronization, refer to CHT Sync.
Some times when couch2pg is replicating documents to postgres, it encounters very large info docs that are larger than the memory allocation of the document sync array and causes out-of-memory errors. To fix this, we need to delete this document so that couch2pg can proceed. Below are steps to follow to achieve this.
Reduce the size of the replicated docs to a value of say 4 in the couch2pg.</description></item></channel></rss>
