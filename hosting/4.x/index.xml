Migrating data from an existing instance running CHT 3.x requires a few manual steps. This guide will present the required steps while using a migration helping tool, called couchdb-migration. This tool interfaces with CouchDb, to update shard maps and database metadata. By the end of this guide, your CHT-Core 3.x CouchDb will be down and CHT-Core 4.x ready to be used.</description></item><item><title>App Developer Hosting in CHT 4.x</title><link>https://docs.communityhealthtoolkit.org/hosting/4.x/app-developer/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://docs.communityhealthtoolkit.org/hosting/4.x/app-developer/</guid><description>This guide assumes you are a CHT app developer wanting to either run concurrent instances of the CHT, or easily be able to switch between different instances without losing any data while doing so. To do development on the CHT Core Framework itself, see the development guide.
To deploy the CHT 3.x in production, see either AWS hosting or Self hosting. To deploy 4.x in production see the 4.x documentation.</description></item></channel></rss>
