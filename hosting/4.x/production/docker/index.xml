These instructions are for changing to either a pre-existing certificate or automatically creating and renewing a Certbot based certificate using ACME, like Let&amp;rsquo;s Encrypt.
This guide assumes you&amp;rsquo;ve already met the hosting requirements, specifically around Docker being installed.
Pre-existing certificateTo load your certificates into your CHT instance, we&amp;rsquo;ll be creating an interstitial container called cht-temp-tls which will enable you to copy your local certificate files into the native docker volume.</description></item><item><title>Viewing server logs in CHT 4.x</title><link>https://docs.communityhealthtoolkit.org/hosting/4.x/production/docker/logs/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://docs.communityhealthtoolkit.org/hosting/4.x/production/docker/logs/</guid><description>CHT 4.x has the following services running via Docker and each can have its logs queried:
nginx sentinel api haproxy couchdb healthcheck upgrade-service Setting log levelBy default, the CHT server logs are set to the info level. To change the log level to debug, you can set the NODE_ENV environment variable to development. A log level of debug can affect system performance and cause log files sizes to grow rapidly. It is recommended to temporarily set the log level to debug only when needed for troubleshooting.</description></item><item><title>Backups in CHT 4.x</title><link>https://docs.communityhealthtoolkit.org/hosting/4.x/production/docker/backups/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://docs.communityhealthtoolkit.org/hosting/4.x/production/docker/backups/</guid><description>This guide is about backups in CHT 4.x - there&amp;rsquo;s the self hosted guide for 3.x which includes backups for 3.x.
IntroductionAs CHT 4.x uses a container per service, the only data that needs to be backed up is:
CouchDB database Docker Compose and .env files TLS certificates This is because Docker containers are inherently stateless so all the important binaries are already stored in CHT&amp;rsquo;s Docker images. Docker Compose files, including the .</description></item></channel></rss>
