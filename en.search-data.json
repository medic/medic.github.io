{"/building/":{"data":{"":"This section provides an introduction to CHT Applications, provides some sample CHT Applications, and provides guides and reference materials for those wanting to build a CHT Application or deploy an existing one.\nCommunity Health Toolkit (CHT) Applications are digital health tools built using the CHT Core Framework. The Core Framework provides a foundation on which custom CHT Applications are built. Since all CHT Applications share the same foundation, they also share capabilities and attributes. For example, all CHT Applications share a similar user-interface and share the same look-and-feel. All CHT Applications can be built to scale, can run across a variety of devices, support Offline-First experiences, and support most languages. These baseline capabilities are foundational across all CHT Applications. Read more about this in Why the CHT?.\nTo create a digital health tool using the Community Health Toolkit, you’ll need to build a CHT Application or re-use an existing CHT Application.\nCHT Applications have been built to support a range of health interventions including antenatal care, postnatal care, family planning, integrated community case management of childhood illness, malnutrition, immunization, and epidemic response. CHT Applications have been built to support users at all levels of the community health system including patients, CHWs, CHW supervisors, nurses, health facility staff, program staff, researchers, and policy makers.\nBeyond the community-level, data from CHT Applications can integrate and/or interoperate with the broader health system through integrations with software such as OpenMRS, DHIS2, and RapidPro.\nPrerequisitesTools and skills needed for developing CHT Applications Getting StartedSet up a local environment to build and test CHT applications CHT ImplementationsConsiderations for digital health implementations"},"title":"Build"},"/building/admin/":{"data":{"":"Content in this section Overview App Management Details"},"title":"App Management"},"/building/admin/admin-overview/":{"data":{"":"App Management is an interface for non-technical administrative users.

Required Resources":"To proceed you need to have ready the following:\nThe URL of your CHT server so users don’t have to type it in post install. The app logo and title. Translations for your supported languages (most flavors don’t need to customize translations though). Also be sure to have a working Development Environment.\nWhile you should use your own branding, the CHT logo is available to use if so desired.","2-new-brand#2. New Brand":"Each branded app has an identifier (id) that is used to identify and configure it in different parts of the source code and when invoking some commands. In the instructions below we will use as example the id new_brand.\nCheck out the tag from the last stable release in CHT Android repository and create a branch, for example, if the latest stable release is v0.11.0 and the branch name is v0.11.0-new-brand, then the command is:\ngit checkout v0.11.0 -b v0.11.0-new-brand Add productFlavors { { ... } } in build.gradle, e.g.:\nnew_brand { dimension = 'brand' applicationId = 'org.medicmobile.webapp.mobile.new_brand' } Add icons, strings etc. in the src/ folder. It’s required to place there at least the src/new_brand/res/values/strings.xml file with the name of the app and the URL of the CHT instance:\n\u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e","3-generate-a-new-keystore#3. Generate a new keystore":"Each branded app created needs its own keystore to sign the binaries for releasing.\nSince the .aab files generated here are signed with the same key you generated, the files and key can be uploaded to the Play Store later and any file generated locally following the steps above will be compatible with any installation made from the Play Store.\nThe keystore files are placed into a compressed and encrypted file in the secrets/ folder. In our case the file will be secrets/secrets-new_brand.tar.gz.enc, and the content inside when the file is decrypted is:\nnew_brand.keystore: the Java keystore with a signature key inside that is always called medicmobile. It’s used to sign the APKs and the bundles, and the one that Google will use to sign the optimized APKs that generates in the Play Store. new_brand_private_key.pepk: a PEPK file is an encrypted file that contains inside the medicmobile key from the keystore above, ready to be uploaded to the Play Store the first time the app is registered in the Play Console. The file is only used there, but kept in the compressed file as a backup. Don’t worry to follow all the name conventions and how to generate these files, you can create all them in one step: the new keystore, the passwords and the PEPK file with make org=new_brand keygen.\nExecuting the command will check that you have the necessary tooling installed, and ask you the information about the certificate like the organization name, organization unit, etc. The command also takes care of picking random passwords that meet the security requirements, and then compresses the key files and finally encrypt the .tar.gz file into the .enc file. At the end of the execution, the script will also show the list of environment variables that you have to setup in CI (Github Actions) and locally in order to sign the apps with the new keystore. Below is an example of executing it to create the keystore for our “new_brand”:\nmake org=new_brand keygen Verifying the following executables are in the $PATH: java keytool openssl ... keytool -genkey -storepass dd8668... -v -keystore new_brand.keystore -alias medicmobile -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 9125 What is your first and last name?

Once committed the .enc file, you can delete the uncompressed and unencrypted version with make org=new_brand keyrm, it will delete the new_brand.keystore, new_brand_private_key.pepk, and the unencrypted .tar.gz files, that are safer kept in the .tar.gz.enc file.\nIf you encounter issues with the make org=new_brand keygen command repeatedly looping through questions, we recommend changing your OS language to English.","4-test-the-keystore-locally#4. Test the keystore locally":"Want to check the keystore? here are a few things you must test before upload to the repository:\nTo decrypt the content like CI does to sign the app, execute: make org=new_brand keydec, it will decrypt and decompress the files removed in the step above. Remember that the environment variables printed in the console needs to be loaded in the CLI. Note that all the variables above end with the suffix _NEW_BRAND, as the id of the app that we pass through the org argument in lowercase, but if Make found the same variables defined without the prefix, they take precedence over the suffix ones.\nExecute make org=new_brand keyprint to see the certificate content, like the org name, the certificate fingerprints, etc.\nSign your app! You can try locally to build the app with the certificate. To create the .apk files run: make org=new_brand flavor=New_brand assemble. The “release” files signed should be placed in build/outputs/apk/new_brand/release/. To ensure the files were signed with the right signature execute make keyprint-apk, it will check the certificate of the first apk file under the build/ folder:\nmake keyprint-apk apksigner verify -v --print-certs build/outputs/apk/new_brand/release/cht-android-SNAPSHOT-new_brand-arm64-v8a-release.apk ... ... Verified using v2 scheme (APK Signature Scheme v2): true ... ... Signer #1 certificate DN: CN=Unknown, OU=New Brand, O=Medic Mobile, L=San Francisco, ST=CA, C=US Signer #1 certificate SHA-256 digest: 7f072b... Also, do the same for the bundle format: build and verify, despite the AAB are not useful for local development. In our example, execute first make org=new_brand flavor=New_brand bundle, and then make keyprint-bundle to see the signature of one of the .aab files generated.\nBecause the files generated here are signed with the same key that you are going to use in CI, and the files produced in CI will be uploaded to the Play Store later, any file generated locally following the steps above will be compatible with any installation made from the Play Store, means that if a user install the app from the Play Store, and then we want to replace the installation with an alpha version generated in CI or a local version generated in dev environment, it will work without requiring the user to uninstall the app and lost the data.","5-release-the-new-flavor#5.

The CHT Android app has enabled by default location request permissions, and the workflow to request the permission follows the strict rules imposed by Google, but they won’t be aware that your flavored app is based on the CHT Android, so you have to provide Google with instructions of how to test the app, specifically how to test the location request.\nTo do so, give them instructions of how to login with the app (with a real username and password), and the basic steps to reach the location request, like open up a form.\nOnce approved you can delete the “test” user, Google conduct the tests only the first time, or when a new permission request is added to the app.","use-case---a-single-android-app-for-many-cht-instances#Use case - a single Android app for many CHT instances":"For specific large deployment scenarios, you might publish a single Android app to serve multiple CHT instances.

All people who are registered in the app must be associated with a Place. These Places are located in a hierarchy with other Places. For instance, a Family Member is part of a Household. A Household and CHWs are part of a CHW Area. A CHW Area and nurses are part of a Health Facility. Additional levels may be added as needed.

Anyone with a profile in your app is a person.\n“Places” is the generic name that represents a level in the hierarchy. “People” belong to “places”, and “places” belong to other higher level “places” in the hierarchy. A “place” could be a geographic area, like a district with the “people” associated to it being health officers. A “place” could also be a structure in the health system, such as a health facility, and the “people” associated to it being nurses. In deployments with CHWs, the lowest “place” in the hierarchy often represents individual households or families, and the individual members of that household are the “people” associated to it.\nUsers can access their “people” and “places” from the People tab. The permissions set for your role and your placement in the hierarchy will determine which contacts you’re able to see.

It is important to train users on the searching functionality described above as this will allow them to find the desired profile of a previously recorded contact instead of creating a duplicate record for the same person or place.\nThe CHT also supports automatically detecting when a contact being created or edited by a user matches an existing contact record. If a duplicate contact is detected, the user will be given the option of proceeding to the profile of the existing contact. Alternatively, the user can choose to override the duplicate detection logic and continue creating/editing the contact as originally intended.\nThe matching logic for duplicate detection is configurable and can be tuned to the specific needs and data structures of a particular project. The algorithm compares the created/edited contact to its sibling contacts. These are other contacts of the same type that share the same parent contact. By default, contacts are considered duplicates if they have very similar names AND (for persons) if they are the same age (in years). This default logic can be overridden with custom logic for each type of contact.","fields#Fields":"","main-list#Main List":"The list view on the leftmost screenshot is what a logged-in CHW would see when they access the “People” tab on a small screen.\nThe item at the top of the list is the “place” the user belongs to.

Individual “people” are not shown here, but will appear in search results.\nBecause this list defaults to show the “places” below the user in the hierarchy, a CHW supervisor would see a different view. Instead of families, they might see a list of CHW Areas they manage.\nNew “places” can be added to this level of the hierarchy by clicking on the “Add new +” button at the bottom of the screen. This allows a CHW to add a new family to their list, or a CHW supervisor to add a new Area they manage.\nWith the UHC Mode configured, the main list of households is displayed as shown on the rightmost screenshot to help health workers ensure that all households are visited regularly.","profiles#Profiles":"Clicking an item on the main list will open a profile where you can see detailed information about that person or place.

When the expression evaluates to true, the contact being created/edited will be considered a duplicate of the existing sibling.\nIn the expression, both the current contact doc (the contact currently being created/edited) and the existing sibling contact doc are available. The default duplicate expression is:\nlevenshteinEq(current.name, existing.name, 3) \u0026\u0026 ageInYears(current) === ageInYears(existing) This expression will consider contacts to be duplicate if the Levenshtein distance between the two names is less than or equal to 3 (meaning the names are very similar or exactly the same) and (for persons) if the contacts have the same age (in years).\nWhen designing custom duplicate check expressions, consider how the contact data collected might evolve over time. If properties are added/removed/renamed on the contact doc, your duplicate expression logic will need to account for this if it references these properties (e.g. support for falling-back to older properties to ensure broader compatibility).\nAlways consider the nature and quality of your data. As data quality improves (e.g., consistent naming conventions), duplicate check expressions for some contact types can be refined to reduce both false positives and false negatives.","expression-functions#Expression functions":"The following functions are available for use in JavaScript expressions:\nSignature Description ageInDays(contact) Returns the current age of the given contact in days. ageInMonth(contact) Returns the current age of the given contact in months. ageInYears(contact) Returns the current age of the given contact in years. levenshteinEq(string0, string1, threshold = 3) (Added 4.19.0) Returns true if the Levenshtein distance between the given strings is less than or equal to the given threshold. Otherwise false. normalizedLevenshteinEq(string0, string1, threshold = 0.42857142857142855) (Added 4.19.0) Similar to the levenshteinEq function except the distance value is “normalized” (by dividing by the length of the longest string) before comparing to the threshold. See below for more details. Normalized Levenshtein Equality In cases where the length of the input strings can vary greatly, the normalizedLevenshteinEq function can be preferable to the levenshteinEq function. The normalizedLevenshteinEq function divides the Levenshtein distance by the length of the longest string before comparing the result to the threshold. In effect, this makes the matching more strict for shorter strings (the actual distance must be shorter for them to be considered equal) and more lenient for longer strings (the actual distance can be longer, but the strings will still be considered equal).\nThis can help make the same threshold limit value appropriate for use across a greater variety of string lengths. For example, if the threshold is set to 0.3, then an actual distance of 2 would be considered equal (when using normalizedLevenshteinEq) for strings of length 9, but not for two strings of length 5. (Because (2 / 9 = 0.2222) \u003c= 0.3 and (2 / 5 = 0.4) \u003e 0.3.)\nWhen using normalized Levenshtein equality, make sure you consider the behavior of a particular threshold value at the edges of your expected string length range. For example, the distance between far and car is 1. If you want your logic to consider john and jon as equal, you will need to use a normalized Levenshtein equality threshold of at least 1 / 4 = 0.25. However, for strings with a length of 25, that threshold will allow a distance of 5 to be considered equal.","form-details#Form details":"","formscontactcontact_type_id-createeditpropertiesjson#\u003ccode\u003eforms/contact/{contact_type_id}-{create|edit}.properties.json\u003c/code\u003e":"Property Description required context Added in 3.10.

It’s important to first understand all the components present in the ecosystem (EMR, laboratory system, community health information system, etc) and then plan out what the workflow will look like operationally. It is important to consider what information is needed at each point, will it be available to them, what happens if it is not, is this workflow even useful for them.\nOne of the biggest challenges in developing integrations between systems is patient matching and/or deduplication. Sometimes this can be controlled operationally, other times it requires complicated algorithms or human intervention.\nBelow are a few example integration use cases:\nLost to Follow-up: EMR generates a list of patients that require follow-up in the community, that list is sent to the CHT and healthworkers receive a task in the CHT to find those patients and refer them to the health facility. Referrals from the community: When a CHW does an assessment and determines the patient should be referred to a health facility, send the referral information to the EMR. Contact Tracing: Similar to Lost to Follow-Up, the EMR generates a list of contacts to be followed up with and this is sent to the CHT so that a tracer can call those contacts to see if they have symptoms. Interactive Messaging: Integrate with a messaging platform (such as RapidPro) to allow community members to initiate self-screening assessments, which can then be sent to the CHT for follow-up by a healthworker. As you design your use cases, creating a sequence diagram will be helpful in illustrating what the flow will look like. Here is an example sequence diagram for an integration use case with RapidPro.","post-data-to-the-cht#POST data to the CHT":"The CHT API also allows you to POST data. Using these endpoints, you can create new records in your CHT API. You can store activities that took place in another system on that contact’s profile in the CHT, and even create tasks for CHWs in the CHT based on activities that took place in the other system.\nExample 1: You use RapidPro to send daily quarantine follow-up messages to a patient. You want to store the patient’s responses to those messages on their profile in the CHT.\nYou can do this by submitting a JSON Form to the records endpoint.\nImportant\nExample 2: Continuing from Example 1, create a task for a CHW in the CHT whenever a patient responds that they have developed symptoms.\nYou would do this by simply configuring a task to be generated based on criteria available in the report that was created in Example 1.","requests-from-other-systems#Requests from other systems":"The CHT has a complete RESTful API that other systems can utilize to interact with data in the CHT.\nThe most common uses are:\nLooking up data in the CHT from another system POSTing data to the CHT from another system","sending-data-to-other-systems#Sending data to other systems":"Using the outbound push feature, you can configure the CHT to send data to another system.

Health workers often carry around heavy logbooks to manually record all relevant activities. When it is time to submit their data, community health workers (CHWs) summarize what was recorded in their logbooks and share this information with their supervisors, who in turn create paper records of these totals across entire community units or health facilities. This paper record is often passed to yet another individual whose responsibility is to manually key in the data into a health information management system, such as DHIS2.\nIn communities using digital health apps that do not integrate with DHIS2, it is highly likely that health workers are duplicating efforts by recording the same information both in their app and in their logbook(s). For example, they are not only registering new pregnancies in their app, but they are also manually recording this in their logbooks, manually adding them up at the end of the month, and then someone else is manually keying this into DHIS2.\nIn communities using digital health apps built with the CHT, health systems can reduce or eliminate the need to complete paper based forms for DHIS2 reporting needs.

Processing includes:\nCleaning First, the data has to be transformed to an OpenMRS-compatible format before it is queued. This means that you need to define custom RESTful endpoints if not already existing, that would be utilized by the Outbound push modules configured above. Transformation basically involves extracting form data into an object. Most importantly, discriminators, which are like flags appended to form data to inform the type of data being processed. For example, a registration discriminator implies that we’re dealing with demographic details. A sample transformed payload is shown below:\n{ \"patient\": { \"patient.family_name\": \"Doe\", \"patient.first_name\": \"John\", \"patient.middle_name\": \"Test\", \"patient.other_identifier\": [ { \"identifier_type_uuid\": \"49af6cdc-7968-4abb-bf46-de10d7f4859f\", \"identifier_type\": \"38839128\", \"identifier_type_name\": \"National ID\", }, { \"identifier_type_uuid\": \"000f85aa-a460-46d1-87be-daabe7bd9d99\", \"identifier_type\": \"1271891\", \"identifier_type_name\": \"Clinic Number\", } ] }, \"observation\": { \"1710^CLIENT CONSENTED^99DCT\": \"1065^Yes^99DCT\", \"1542^OCCUPATION^99DCT\": \"1538^Farmer^99DCT\" }, \"discriminator\": { \"discriminator\": \"registration\" } } Queueing This step involves adding a transformed payload, now objects, to a queue. This is important because it helps to capture errors that occur during processing and the data can be corrected and re-queued. A queue will have both registration and encounter objects.\nYou need to define a queue processor that will be consuming the queue and push each object to the rightful handler.\nData handlers Data handlers are responsible for persisting the data in OpenMRS. The handler can also be used to trigger feedback to submitters of the data (this can be a brief summary such as number of synced documents and success rate). The following steps apply:\nDefine handlers for each object type (e.g. person / patient, trace report. Create a scheduler to start the queue processor above. The queue processor shall get to the handler for processing. Closely monitor the errors log for prompt action where necessary. You may want to further configure a service that relays feedback to the CHT. Feel free to utilize in-app text messages, which can be triggered via the sms endpoint of CHT. The health workers would receive these feedback messages on their phones as well as access via the Messages tab in-app.","listener-script-in-the-cht#Listener script in the CHT":"This is a service that would help shift information in the CHT hierarchy to support the usecases of interest. Through {db}/bulk_docs, OpenMRS posts a data record that contains data objects such as observations and contact list (if available) details. The service obtains the record, and unpacks it into a contact in CHT and parented under the correct hierarchy level based on the metadata received from OpenMRS. The script should:\nDo patient matching to avoid duplicate details. Querying can be achieved via available endpoints such as contacts_by_phone endpoint and hydrate endpoint among others/ If the incoming data matches what exists, update the contact found in CHT. Process all reports payloads and append them to the linked contact’s profile. Note that the xml or JSON form has to be defined in the CHT.

Monitor and log failed transactions Once you have configured the above for data exchange, the data flow will be like this:\nCHT - OpenMRS Data Flow","mapping-forms#Mapping forms":"The first thing is to define forms to capture data. Forms can be contact or app, which translate to patient and encounter (for example, observation, lab request, and referral) respectively. Forms are defined using the XLS Form standard. Some of the best practices here include adopting a convention that results in minimum disruption (or that would require minimal processing) of the concept dictionary.\nDefining contact forms Here, you need to capture the basic details required for registering a patient or a patient contact in OpenMRS. Below is a sample naming convention for demographic details such as a person’s name (under field name):\npatient_familyName for family_name, patient_firstName for first_name, patient_middleName for middle_name\nAnother example of patient identifiers could take the form _IdentifierType_humanReadableName_IdentifierTypeUuid. For example, national Id identifier type definition would be, patient_identifierType_nationalId_49af6cdc-7968-4abb-bf46-de10d7f4859f.\nA sample form definition could be as follows:\ntype name label required relevant appearance constraint constraint_message calculation choice_filter hint default begin group patient_demographics Demographic details string patient_familyName Family name yes string patient_firstName First name yes string patient_middleName Middle name yes string patient_identifierType_nationalId_49af6cdc-7968-4abb-bf46-de10d7f4859f National ID yes end group A sample payload would be as follows:\n{ ..., \"patient_demographics\": { \"patient_familyName\": \"Doe\", \"patient_firstName\": \"John\", \"patient_middleName\": \"Test\", \"patient_identifierType_nationalId_49af6cdc-7968-4abb-bf46-de10d7f4859f\": \"38839128\", \"patient_identifierType_clinicNumber_000f85aa-a460-46d1-87be-daabe7bd9d99\": \"1271891\" } } Such convention makes it easier to process the payload for queueing handling.\nDefining app forms An encounter form consists of input and observation groups in the XForm. form_uuid and encounter_type_uuid define the uuids for the encounter form and encounter type respectively. Note that these are defined within the general input group provided by CHT.\nThe observation group is used to define the clinical observation variables to be collected by the form. This group is equivalent to the group of in OpenMRS html form entry module. In OpenMRS, an observation construct has concept ID (with inherent concept type), label, and answer options if it requires. In Xforms, one needs to define the following:\nObservation type (field type of the xlsform)\nName - this will be used as key in the generated JSON payload for the form data. Using the adopted convention above, _conceptID_humanReadableConceptName_99DCT, we could have:\n_5089_weight_99DC for weight.\nFor multi-select (obs group in OpenMRS), we can easily append MULTISELECT to the humanReadableConceptName for example: _162558_disabilityTypeMULTISELECT_99DCT for disability type with the options blind, dumb, ...\nA label which is displayed to the user during form entry\nHere is a sample form snippet followed by sample select list in the choices worksheet.","openmrs-to-cht#OpenMRS to CHT":"","overview#Overview":"The CHT Core Framework supports integrations with OpenMRS in a variety of ways:\nSending patient and patient contacts data Sending reports (encounters and observations) data Exposing an API for OpenMRS developers to pull data from CHT Core Receiving data from OpenMRS Sending patients, patient contacts, and reports data can be achieved using the Outbound push.

App forms are typically created in the project-folder \u003e forms \u003e app directory of a project.

RapidPro allows you to visually build messaging workflows for mobile-based services. The flows support a variety of technologies such as: SMS, USSD, IVR, Telegram, Facebook Messenger, and WhatsApp. Review RapidPro’s documentation to familiarize yourself with various components that include the API. Before you embark on designing an integrated RapidPro/CHT workflow, you should start by understanding the needs of your users, identifying a problem to solve, and establishing goals. While an integrated RapidPro/CHT workflow can open up many powerful and personalized messaging capabilities, introducing an additional technology solution does come with complexities and cost. A good way to mitigate some of the complexities of setting up and hosting RapidPro yourself is to utilize a SaaS solution such as TextIt. TextIt offers transparent per message pricing and free credits to start off.\nTo learn more about the platform, check out RapidPro on GitHub or join their Google Group.\nComing up with a design to accommodate user needs requires a detailed understanding of the capabilities of both systems and conceptually where it makes sense to introduce interactions between them. Below we introduce some of the key concepts in RapidPro, but to learn more you can have a look at their documentation.","best-practices#Best Practices":"","campaigns#Campaigns":"Campaigns allow you to schedule messages and flows around a date unique to each contact in a group, like a delivery date or registration date. You can add any number of Events to the Campaign.\nUse Case Example: Send a daily check-in message to quarantined patients for 14 days to see if they have developed any symptoms.\nAdditional Resources: Creating a Campaign","chw-symptom-and-mental-health-checks#CHW Symptom and Mental Health Checks":"The CHW Symptom and Mental Health Checks app is used to proactively check in with health workers to screen for COVID-19 symptoms and/or the need for psychosocial counseling.","configuration#Configuration":"The information below focuses on specific interactions between RapidPro and the CHT, it does not cover RapidPro specific configuration, consult RapidPro documentation and resources for that. Also, the examples and code snippets below are using TextIt, the hosted RapidPro service mentioned above.","configuration-1#Configuration":"Persist a unique identifier for each respondent entering the flows. This identifier shall be used to link flow runs to the recipients to make data analysis smooth. Use consistent language and message design patterns to maintain a consistent experience and conversation. For example, if including a contact name at the beginning of a message, keep it that way for all messages including the localized messages. Be mindful of when you save data back to the CHT. This should happen at major milestones in a flow, for example, end of a flow or before sending a payload to an API endpoint. Use globals, shared values that can be referenced inflows, as well as broadcasts and campaigns, within your account referenced by @globals.value_name. This prevents re-entry of values in various components and allows flows to be shared easily in staging and production environments. Beware of concurrency that is not supported in RapidPro. Concurrency refers to a situation whereby one contact participates in more than one flow at the same time. Whenever this happens, the former flow shall be interrupted in favor of the latter. This can result in respondents exiting flows before completion, which is a confusing user experience and results in poor survey data. A main flow that spins up individual flows may be useful to consider.","contact-tracing#Contact Tracing":"The COVID-19 Contact Tracing app uses RapidPro to send messages to quarantined COVID-19 patients. Messages are sent to the patients daily asking whether or not they developed new symptoms. If so, a health worker will be notified by SMS and receive a CHT task. All responses to the RapidPro workflow are recorded in the CHT and can be queried in analytics.","create-rapidpro-user-in-cht#Create RapidPro user in CHT":"For RapidPro to communicate with the CHT, you need to create a User in the CHT that will be used by RapidPro when calling the CHT’s APIs. This can be done from the App Management page in the CHT. When adding the user in the CHT, be sure to select the Gateway - Limited access user for Medic Gateway Role.","deployment#Deployment":"Make sure all your flows are in source control. For every change, no matter how small (fixing a typo, etc), at the very least, document and commit the JSON for the flows to Github. This makes flows restorable, auditable, and releasable across environments Use an automated deployment process when pushing changes to an instance - either staging or production. A CI/CD reduces manual errors and ensures your production state is tested and reproducible. Remember to set up the rapidpro2pg service to get your RapidPro workspace data over to the Postgres database.","flow-design#Flow design":"Tips and best practices are listed below:\nIf possible, have less than 10 questions. Long surveys may either lead to low completion rates or rushed responses that affects the data quality. Close ended questions are better and easier to respond and handle in RapidPro since respondents only have to send a number or letter such as 1 for “Yes”, 2 for “No”. Avoid sensitive questions since privacy cannot be guaranteed over SMS and where it is common to share phones. Include intro and outro messages. Intro messages serve the purpose of giving the survey details such as the background of the survey, the number of questions, data protection, whether there shall be follow up, SMS billing, etc. Outro messages are helpful to notify respondents that they survey is over and commonly include thank you notes. Include questions that give the respondent an opportunity to opt-in or out of the survey. If they opt out, do not send a follow-up text. Keep it short, to the size of one SMS (160 characters). Longer messages will be split and may not display well on the recipients’ devices since Mobile Network Operators (MNOs) cannot guarantee that the multi-parts shall be delivered in the desired order. Retain the same message length as you localize to multiple languages. Truncate appropriately if long contact names included in the message push the length beyond the limit.","flow-programming#Flow programming":"Use skip logic to ask relevant questions only. For example, number of children only if they have children. Automate error messages to validate responses. For example, You submitted an invalid response. Reply 1 for “Yes”, 2 for “No”. These can be customized. Reduce unnecessary messaging by using reminders and follow-up messages selectively on respondents by first differentiating those that completed a flow versus those that did not. Customize messages as much as possible by pre-populating information already known such as name, to target respondents, especially when phones are shared among clients. Translate all messages, especially when deploying in a multi-lingual environment. This ensures that respondents fully understand the survey in their language. Beware of the timing of the surveys that directly affects response rates. From experience, sending questions when respondents are busy with their errands during the day ultimately leads to low response rates as opposed to evenings when they are done for the day. Make sure you handle unsolicited responses by redirecting such to, for example, a flow that eventually alerts concerned individuals such as reports of an outbreak. Use timeouts or pauses to send automatic messages after a period of inactivity during a survey. This helps nudge the respondents to complete their flows.","flows#Flows":"Flows are a series of steps you link together visually to define the interactions users will have. At any point in the flow, you can trigger actions such as sending an SMS, email, or calling external APIs. Flows are the base for RapidPro’s other features.\nUse Case Example: Send an SMS to a patient asking if they are experiencing any new symptoms today. If so, let the patient know that a CHW will contact them. If not, let the patient know that they will receive another check-in message in three days and to contact their CHW if any new symptoms develop before then.\nAdditional Resource: How to Build a RapidPro Flow.","globals#Globals":"Globals are shared values that can be referenced in flows, as well as broadcasts and campaigns, within your account referenced by @globals.value_name. They allow you to create a value once and use it repeatedly without having to reenter the value. Likewise, globals make updating a shared value much easier. Rather than manually changing a value everywhere it’s used in your account, simply update the value found in your Globals page.\nGlobals\nOnce you have configured a Global value, you can easily use it in your flows like this:\nGlobals-Usage","look-up-cht-data-from-rapidpro#Look up CHT data from RapidPro":"Another common action you will likely need to perform in RapidPro is getting information from the CHT about a user or patient based on their phone number. You can use the contacts-by-phone API to get fully hydrated contacts associated to that phone number.","messages#Messages":"If language options are included allow users to select their preference before beginning the flow Make sure the language and terminology of your messages are appropriate for the audience Use a personalized welcome message before asking users to take actions Keep content brief and relevant to the topic as to not overload the user Make your response requests and calls-to-action clear Be cognizant of form collisions during assessments (ex. “0=no, 1=yes” if those numbers may also reference workflow codes, or “N=no” if “N” is the code to create a new person) Use standards in logic where possible (ex. The non-zero value is true; 0=false, 1=true, 0=no, 1=yes) Sign the first message with the partner’s name, or MOH for visibility Consider providing an option to revisit information again (ex. Text 123 to this number to receive these messages again)","monitoring#Monitoring":"Make sure you are monitoring workflows. Are they finishing as expected? Are some workflows not being used? A useful feature is the “send email” action whenever an unexpected event occurs while the flow is in progress, for example, failure calling an API endpoint. Include relevant parties in the monitoring notifications. For starters, a mailing group that includes all parties will do it without re-entry of each address of relevant recipients. Include notifications to respondents too, appropriate to the messaging method. Check that your workspace has enough credits and ensure RapidPro email credit alerts are configured so that credits top ups are done promptly.","overview#Overview":"CHT-based SMS workflows can be configured to support registering of new patients or pregnancies, recording outcomes of visits, confirmation via auto-responses, and scheduling reminders. Some projects are designed entirely around SMS workflows. The CHT also supports person to person SMS messaging from the Messages tab.\nFor more complex messaging workflows or to utilize other messaging platforms, you can design workflows that leverage the functionality of RapidPro and the CHT together. This enables semi-automated, direct to patient approaches to health assessments and care coordination at the community level.","rapidpro-concepts#RapidPro Concepts":"Before designing your integrated RapidPro/CHT workflow, it’s important to understand a couple key functional concepts in RapidPro: Flows, Campaigns, and Triggers.","remote-training#Remote Training":"The Remote Training by SMS app uses RapidPro to train health workers on Antenatal Care in the language of their choice. If the health worker answers a training question incorrectly, a task can be created for their supervisor to follow up with them.","save-flow-data-to-the-cht#Save flow data to the CHT":"Once a user has completed a Flow in RapidPro, it is likely you will want to record some of the information collected in the RapidPro flow back in the CHT. This can be achieved by utilizing the Call Webhook action in RapidPro.\nStep Application Config step 1 CHT Configure a JSON Form that includes the fields from RapidPro you want to send to the CHT. 2 RapidPro Add a Call a Webhook node. 3 RapidPro POST to the records endpoint in the CHT.

Below is an overview and example diagram for a patient initiated triage and feedback workflow.\nPatient triggers a RapidPro flow by sending a message to a short code Using the phone number of the patient, RapidPro requests information from the CHT The CHT responds with the patient’s name and other details RapidPro sends personalized messages to conduct triage for the patient RapidPro determines the outcome RapidPro sends the outcome to the patient via SMS and posts the results to the CHT If the patient needs to be followed-up with, the CHT creates a task for the appropriate CHW Once the CHW completes that task, the CHT initiates the Feedback Flow in RapidPro RapidPro logic records feedback via SMS from the patient The results of the feedback flow are saved in the CHT Sequence","sms-messaging-channels#SMS Messaging Channels":"RapidPro supports both Android channels and SMS aggregators.\nNote\nAndroid channels have a messaging limit of 330 outgoing messages per hour.\nEnsure that you install the maximum number of SMS packs (available in the RapidPro SMS Channel Android app) and follow these best practices when using Android channels:\nPrevent the Android channel from going to sleep. Some steps to achieve this are available on dontkillmyapp:\nDo not optimize battery usage. Make sure that the app is on the list of Apps that will not be put to sleep. Set Background Limit to Standard Limit and confirm that the RapidPro app has the toggle enabled in “Background Check” and all of the apps have “App Standby state: ACTIVE” in Standby apps. Keep the phone plugged into a power source. Automatically wake up the phone.\nThe RapidPro system uses Google Cloud Messaging which wakes up the phone whenever a message is sent. Install an APK that makes the channel relay messages as soon as RapidPro emits. Alerts for when things go wrong.\nSend monitoring emails and alert various parties when the Android Channel goes to sleep or becomes unavailable. This can be done from the channel’s management page under Alert Email Android channels can be used with a bulk sender to get past the 330 outgoing messages per hour.\nUse shared or dedicated shortcodes for SMS messaging. Dedicated shortcodes are preferred because recipients do not have to include the keyword with each response submitted. Shortcode procurement can be a lengthy process, so make arrangements for the shortcode in advance. It is possible but inconvenient to migrate to a shortcode after deployment.\nIt is recommended that SMS costs be zero-rated so that respondents do not incur charges. This motivates them to respond.","start-rapidpro-flow-from-cht#Start RapidPro Flow from CHT":"One of the most common activities you’ll want to do is trigger a Flow in RapidPro based on something that occurred in the CHT. For example… whenever a specific form is submitted in the CHT with some conditional value, start a flow in RapidPro. To do this, you will use the Outbound feature in the CHT, invoking the Flow Starts Endpoint in RapidPro.\nBelow is an example outbound config in the CHT called textit-self-quarantine that will trigger a flow in RapidPro whenever a covid_trace_follow_up form is submitted in the CHT where symptom = no. It will also pass an extra date value for self_quarantine_enrollment.\n{ \"textit-self-quarantine\": { \"relevant_to\": \"doc.type === 'data_record' \u0026\u0026 doc.form === 'covid_trace_follow_up' \u0026\u0026 doc.fields.trace.symptom === 'no'\", \"destination\": { \"base_url\": \"https://textit.in\", \"auth\": { \"type\": \"header\", \"name\": \"Authorization\", \"value_key\": \"textit.in\" }, \"path\": \"/api/v2/flow_starts.json\" }, \"mapping\": { \"flow\": { \"expr\": \"'\" }, \"urns\": { \"expr\": \"[ 'tel:' + doc.fields.inputs.contact.phone ]\", \"optional\": false }, \"extra.self_quarantine_enrollment\": { \"expr\": \"new Date(doc.reported_date).getDate()+'-'+ (new Date(doc.reported_date).getMonth()+1) +'-' + new Date(doc.reported_date).getFullYear()+ ' ' + new Date(doc.reported_date).getHours() + ':' + new Date(doc.reported_date).getMinutes()\", \"optional\": false }, \"extra.name\": \"doc.fields.inputs.contact.surname\" } } }","testing#Testing":"Testing includes manual and scripted.\nManual testing\nTelegram is an effective, free, convenient tool for testing that is great for developers and quick testing. Prior to release, it is crucial that you test the workflow as close to production as possible. Use the production messaging channels, to especially check messaging fidelity. It is recommended to run a pilot prior to scaling a deployment. Remember, this shall expose the flows to real respondents and be helpful towards uncovering details such as text display among others. In order to prevent breakages in flows, run full end-to-end tests as edits/changes can have unpredictable impacts. Check that the entire flow is not impacted by the change prior to releasing in production. Scripted testing\nThese tests cover the parts that are inaccessible via manual tests. They include units that test individual components and end-to-end tests that test a flow from start to end. As a best practice, the following test pattern using the cht-conf-test-harness is recommended:\nCreate contact doc via cht-conf-test-harness PUT docs into localhost API Trigger RapidPro flow Wait for a RapidPro flow to complete Fetch state of contact in RapidPro Wait for document to be created in API Inject document into cht-conf-test-harness Mock passage of time to test task behavior One e2e test per production scenario","triggers#Triggers":"Triggers allow you to control how or when a Flow begins. A Trigger can be a keyword received in a text, a point in time, a missed call, or even a follow to a Twitter handle.\nUse Case Example: Start a health assessment Flow whenever a person sends the text assessment to a specific short code.\nAdditional Resources: Creating a Keyword Trigger that starts a Flow","workflow-design#Workflow Design":"Designing an integrated workflow between multiple systems is more of an art than a science. Drafting a sequence diagram (below) is a good first step. When drafting your sequence diagram, it is useful to consider a few key integration touchpoints that are common across many integrated workflows.\nOne system initiates or triggers an action in the other system One system needs to get information from the other system One system wants to store or update data in the other system","workflows#Workflows":"Integrated RapidPro/CHT workflows are very flexible and leverage the full functionality of each application; You configure RapidPro directly in RapidPro, and configure the CHT in the CHT and the two systems communicate with each other through APIs and Outbound push. With this architecture, you are not limited to a subset of functionality within either application.\nA simple RapidPro/CHT integration might include triggering an interactive SMS messaging flow in RapidPro whenever a new patient is registered in the CHT and then storing the responses of that messaging flow in the CHT. You could then conditionally trigger a Task for a health worker in the CHT based on the patient responses from the RapidPro flow.\nApp builders have built and deployed a number of interactive messaging workflows that integrate RapidPro and the CHT already, see below for a few examples.","workspaces#Workspaces":"A workspace contains models for a set of RapidPro users, and it also identifies a company or project.

Patients in CHT applications are represented as contacts, and require a parent to be assigned to a CHW, facility, or other location. This requires a mediator to have the ids of contacts in CHT and currently cannot be done automatically by the default mediator. A custom mediator needs to be created which assigns a field to use as the parent_id.\nTo create data in CHT, a mediator converts a FHIR Patient to a json object that it submits as a request to the records API. This requires a form to be configured in the CHT; the incoming data will be saved as a report. Then, the actual patient document is created by assigning a create patient transition to the form.\nBecause the patient creation form is a CHT form like any other, messages, validations and other transitions can be assigned to it to build more complex workflows.\nThis example form allows an interoperating system to create a patient with some common fields: patient_name, age_in_days, phone_number, and an id in the external system. In this example, location_id is used as the parent_id field; this field will usually have to be configured in a custom mediator.\nField Description patient_name Patient’s name. phone_number Patient’s phone number. age_in_days Patient’s age, in days. sex Patient’s sex. external_id The preferred identifier from the external system. { \"INTEROP_PATIENT\": { \"meta\": { \"code\": \"interop_patient\", }, \"fields\": { \"age_in_days\": { \"labels\": { \"short\": { \"en\": \"Age in Days\" } }, \"position\": 0, \"type\": \"integer\", \"required\": true }, \"patient_name\": { \"labels\": { \"short\": { \"en\": \"Patient Name\" } }, \"position\": 1, \"type\": \"string\", \"length\": [ 1, 40 ], \"required\": true }, \"phone_number\": { \"labels\": { \"short\": { \"en\": \"patient Phone\" } }, \"position\": 2, \"flags\":{ \"allow_duplicate\": false }, \"type\": \"phone_number\", \"required\": true }, \"location_id\": { \"labels\": { \"short\": { \"en\": \"location_id\" } }, \"position\": 3, \"type\": \"string\", \"length\": [ 1, 60 ], \"required\": true }, \"external_id\": { \"labels\": { \"short\": { \"en\": \"External ID\" } }, \"position\": 4, \"type\": \"string\", \"length\": [ 1, 60 ], \"required\": true } }, \"public_form\": true } } Using the above example form, this transition will create a patient document and add a birth_date field using patient_age_in_days.\n{ \"form\": \"interop_patient\", \"events\": [ { \"name\": \"on_create\", \"trigger\": \"add_birth_date\", \"params\": \"\", \"bool_expr\": \"doc.patient_name\" }, { \"name\": \"on_create\", \"trigger\": \"add_patient\", \"params\": { \"parent_id\": \"location_id\" }, \"bool_expr\": \"doc.patient_name\" } ] }","inbound-reports#Inbound Reports":"Encounters and Observations created by interoperating systems can be sent to the CHT to be visible to CHT users. Similarly to patients, a mediator converts the FHIR resources to a json format that is submitted to the records API. Reports need to be linked to patients using a patient_id field which is the uuid of the patient document in CHT. The mediator extracts this id from the CHT Document ID identifier of the FHIR Patient. For patients created by CHT, they need to have been sent to the interoperating system before receiving any reports. For patients created by the interoperating system, the CHT Document ID needs to have been set; see the section below on Patient Ids.\nA CHT form needs to be configured to receive the reports via the records API. In the form configuration, the names of fields which should be extracted from Observations should be the codes of the Observations. Human readable labels can be added for display.\nBecause these forms are CHT forms like any other, messages, validations and other transitions can be assigned to them to build more complex workflows.\nThis example configures the form for a typical antenatal care form.\n{ \"INTEROP_ANC\": { \"meta\": { \"code\": \"interop_anc\", \"translation_key\": \"forms.interop_anc.title\", \"icon\": \"icon-anc-followup\" }, \"fields\": { \"patient_id\": { \"labels\": { \"short\": { \"en\": \"Patient Id\" } }, \"position\": 0, \"type\": \"string\", \"length\": [ 1, 13 ], \"required\": true }, \"17a57368-5f59-42c8-aaab-f2774d21501e\": { \"labels\": { \"short\": { \"en\": \"Danger signs screening\" } }, \"position\": 1, \"type\": \"string\", \"length\": [ 1, 20 ], \"required\": false }, \"1427aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa\": { \"labels\": { \"short\": { \"en\": \"Date of last menstrual period\" } }, \"position\": 2, \"type\": \"string\", \"length\": [ 1, 60 ], \"required\": false }, \"5596aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa\": { \"labels\": { \"short\": { \"en\": \"Estimated date of delivery\" } }, \"position\": 3, \"type\": \"string\", \"length\": [ 1, 60 ], \"required\": false } }, \"public_form\": true } }","outbound-patients#Outbound Patients":"When sending Patient data collected from CHT to an interoperating system, first identify which documents represent patients. In the example below, a patient is a document with type person and role patient. This may not apply to all CHT applications. Then, create an outbound push configuration to send these documents to the interoperating system.\nThe outbound push config contains the following fields.\nField Description relevant_to An “expression” (some JS code that resolves to a truthy or falsy value) that defines which documents are patients. base_url The url of the OpenHIM instance where the mediator is hosted path /mediator/cht/patient Add a condition in the relevant_to field; whenever any documents matching this condition are created or updated, a request will be sent to the url specified in base_url and path.\nThe fields in the patient document need to be mapped to the FHIR format. It is possible to convert the document to a FHIR Patient resource in outbound push config (an example can be found in the reference application). This can be difficult to configure correctly, so the default mediator also accepts a shorter form which is the id, name, phone, date_of_birth and patient_id fields from the document itself.\nThe mapping field in outbound push config contains the following fields.\nField Description _id CouchDB’s unique identifier of the record. This will be converted to an Identifier with type CHT Document Id. name Patient’s name. phone Patient’s phone number. date_of_birth Patient’s date of birth. sex Patient’s sex. patient_id If a separate patient_id is generated, it can be sent here. This will be converted to an Identifier with type CHT Patient Id. This example outbound push config selects documents where patient_id exists, and doc.role === patient:\n{ \"patient\": { \"relevant_to\": \"doc.type === 'person' \u0026\u0026 doc.patient_id \u0026\u0026 doc.role === 'patient'\", \"destination\": { \"base_url\": \"http://openhim-core:5001\", \"path\": \"/mediator/cht/patient\", \"auth\": { \"type\": \"basic\", \"username\": \"interop-client\", \"password_key\": \"openhim1\" } }, \"mapping\": { \"doc._id\": \"doc._id\", \"doc.name\": \"doc.name\", \"doc.phone\": \"doc.phone\", \"doc.date_of_birth\": \"doc.date_of_birth\", \"doc.sex\": \"doc.sex\", \"doc.patient_id\": \"doc.patient_id\" } } }","outbound-reports#Outbound Reports":"To send reports from the CHT to an interoperating system, an Encounter resource is created to represent the encounter between the patient and the CHW. Any data in the report that is sent to the interoperating system is represented as Observations linked to the Encounter.\nEncounters have a reference to Patients, so setting up outbound patients is a requirement for outbound reports.\nSimilarly to patients, create an outbound push configuration with the relevant_to field having doc.type === 'data_record' \u0026\u0026 doc.form === '{{the form to be sent}}'.\nThe outbound push config contains the following fields.\nField Description relevant_to An “expression” (some JS code that resolves to a truthy or falsy value) that defines which forms should be sent. doc.type === 'data_record' \u0026\u0026 doc.form === '{{the form to be sent}}'. base_url The url of the OpenHIM instance where the mediator is hosted. path /mediator/cht/encounter The fields in the form that need to be exchanged need to be mapped to a format that a mediator can convert to Observations. Observations need to have a Code that is understood by the interoperating system, and the response values may need to be converted to a different format.\nFor example a yes/no question may need to be converted to the presence (if yes) or absence (if no) of an observation with a code.\n“Does the patient show signs of fever?” can be converted to an observation with the code for fever if the answer was yes, or be omitted entirely if the answer was no.\nAnother example is multiple choice questions, which can be converted to a coded question where each of the choices is assigned a code.\n“Which danger signs does the patient show?” can be converted to Observations with the code for pregnancy danger signs, and for each danger sign selected, the value is the code of the danger sign.\nThe mapping field in outbound push config contains the following fields.\nField Description id CouchDB’s unique identifier of the record. This will be converted to an Identifier with type CHT Document Id. patient_uuid Document uuid of the patient document that is the subject of the report. reported_date Date when the report was made. observations A list of the form fields to be converted to Observations, with format observations.{{number}}.code and observations.{{number}}.{{value}} where value can be one of valueCode, valueDateTime and valueString. observation.n.code For each form field to convert to observations, a code for the observation. observation.n.valueCode For multiple choice questions with valueCoded responses, the code for the response value. If false, the observation will be omitted. observation.n.valueDateTime For datetime questions, the date for the value. observation.n.valueString For string questions, the value. In this example, a danger signs question is converted into Observations where danger signs has code 17a57368-5f59-42c8-aaab-f2774d21501e, and the yes/no questions fever and breathlessness with codes 43221561-0600-410e-8932-945665533510 and 070dca86-c275-4369-b405-868904d78156 are present if the response was yes or absent if the response was no.\n{ \"relevant_to\": \"doc.type === 'data_record' \u0026\u0026 doc.form === 'pregnancy'\", \"destination\": { \"base_url\": \"http://openhim-core:5001\", \"path\": \"/mediator/cht/encounter\", \"auth\": { \"type\": \"basic\", \"username\": \"interop-client\", \"password_key\": \"openhim1\" } }, \"mapping\": { \"id\": \"doc._id\", \"patient_uuid\": \"doc.fields.inputs.contact._id\", \"reported_date\": \"doc.reported_date\", \"observations.0.code\": { \"expr\": \"\\\"17a57368-5f59-42c8-aaab-f2774d21501e\\\"\" }, \"observations.0.valueCode\": { \"expr\": \"doc.fields.danger_signs.fever == \\\"yes\\\" ? \\\"43221561-0600-410e-8932-945665533510\\\" : false\" }, \"observations.1.code\": { \"expr\": \"\\\"17a57368-5f59-42c8-aaab-f2774d21501e\\\"\" }, \"observations.1.valueCode\": { \"expr\": \"doc.fields.danger_signs.breathlessness == \\\"yes\\\" ? \\\"070dca86-c275-4369-b405-868904d78156\\\" : false\" }, \"observations.2.code\": { \"expr\": \"\\\"1427AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA\\\"\" }, \"observations.2.valueDateTime\": \"doc.fields.lmp_date\", \"observations.3.code\": { \"expr\": \"\\\"5596AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA\\\"\" }, \"observations.3.valueDateTime\": \"doc.fields.expected_date\", \"observations.4.code\": { \"expr\": \"\\\"13179cce-a424-43d7-9ad1-dce7861946e8\\\"\" }, \"observations.4.valueString\": \"doc.fields.danger_signs.other_any\" } }","overview#Overview":"CHT has an interoperability tool which supports building FHIR workflows.

You can view the API documentation for creating an Endpoint here. Once you send the request, the Mediator will return a JSON response containing the id of the newly created endpoint. Save this id for the next step.\nHTTP Request - Create an Organization Resource in the Mediator using as endpoint.reference the example value replacing ${ENDPOINT_ID} with the actual id of the Endpoint you created in the previous step. Once you send the request, the Mediator will return a JSON response containing the id of the newly created Organization. You can view the API documentation for creating an Organization here.\nIt is important to note that you only need to create an Organization once, which you can use for future requests. So, after creating the Organization, you can save the organization.identifier[0].value value and use it for all future ServiceRequest requests.\nCreate a Patient\nCHT - Log in to the CHT platform using the credentials for the chw user. If the chw user does not already exist, you can create one. CHT - Navigate to the People tab in the CHT dashboard. From there, select a Facility where you want to create a new Person. Click on the New Person button and fill in the required details for the Person. Make sure to select Patient as the Person’s role for this flow. CHT - Once you have created the new Person, you need to retrieve their unique identifier from the browser’s URL. You can do this by copying the alphanumeric string that appears after person/ in the URL. Keep this identifier safe as you will need it for the next steps. OpenHIM Admin Console - To verify that the Patient creation was successful, navigate to the Transaction Log in the OpenHIM Admin Console. You should see two successful API calls recorded in the log, one to /mediator/patient/ and one to /fhir/Patient/. Request the LTFU for the Patient\nHTTP Request - To trigger the LTFU process for the newly created patient, you need to create a ServiceRequest. You can refer to the API documentation available here to learn how to create a ServiceRequest. Replace the requester.reference and the subject.reference with the Organization and Patient identifiers respectively. Once the ServiceRequest is received by the mediator, it will initiate the LTFU workflow for the patient, which includes reminders for follow-up appointments and check-ins.\nHTTP Request - Verify that the ServiceRequest was successful in both OpenHIM Mediator \u0026 FHIR Resource. Navigate to the Transaction Log in the Admin Console. You should see three successful API calls, as in the image below: Handle LTFU Task\nCHT - Navigate to the Tasks tab. There should be an automatically created Task for the Patient. If it is not the case, sync data via Sync now option. The Task should look like in the image below:\nCHT - Select an option (Yes or No) and submit the Tasks.\nOpenHIM Admin Console - Verify that the Encounter creation was successful in both OpenHIM Mediator \u0026 FHIR Resource.

In order to test in the APK, your CHT instance needs a valid TLS certificate which the default docker version does not have.\nTo install a valid certificate, open a terminal in the cht-core directory. Ensure the CHT instance is running and make this call:\n./scripts/add-local-ip-certs-to-docker.sh cht_nginx_1 If add-local-ip-certs-to-docker-4.x.sh is not in your scripts directory, be sure to use git or GitHub Desktop to update your local repository with the latest changes.

The IP of your computer is used in the URL of the CHT instance now. For example, if your IP is 192.168.68.40 then the CHT URL with a valid TLS certificate is 192-168-68-40.local-ip.medicmobile.org. See the local-ip.medicmobile.org site to read more about these free-to-use certificates.\nWhen using cht-conf you can now drop the use of --accept-self-signed-certs.

If additional endpoints would be helpful, make suggestions via a GitHub issue.\nSettings GET /api/v1/settings PUT /api/v1/settings Export GET /api/v2/export/dhis GET /api/v2/export/reports GET /api/v2/export/messages GET /api/v2/export/feedback GET /api/v2/export/contacts GET /api/v2/export/user-devices Forms GET /api/v1/forms GET /api/v1/forms/{{id}}.{{format}} POST /api/v1/forms/validate Records POST /api/v2/records SMS POST /api/sms POST /api/v1/sms/{aggregator}/{endpoint} Contact GET/api/v1/contact/{{uuid}} GET /api/v1/contact/uuid Person GET /api/v1/person/{{uuid}} GET /api/v1/person People Supported Properties POST /api/v1/people Place GET /api/v1/place/{{uuid}} GET /api/v1/place Places Supported Properties POST /api/v1/places POST /api/v1/places/{{id}} Report GET/api/v1/report/{{uuid}} GET /api/v1/report/uuid Users Supported Properties GET /api/v1/users GET /api/v2/users GET /api/v2/users/{{username}} POST /api/v1/users POST /api/v2/users POST /api/v1/users/{{username}} DELETE /api/v1/users/{{username}} GET /api/v1/users-info Bulk Operations POST /api/v1/bulk-delete Monitoring GET /api/v1/monitoring GET /api/v2/monitoring GET /api/v1/express-metrics Upgrades POST /api/v1/upgrade POST /api/v1/upgrade/stage POST /api/v1/upgrade/complete Hydrate GET /api/v1/hydrate POST /api/v1/hydrate Contacts by phone GET /api/v1/contacts-by-phone POST /api/v1/contacts-by-phone Replication Limit GET /api/v1/users-doc-count Credentials PUT /api/v1/credentials 3.x API Impact GET /api/v1/impact Note\nVarious properties throughout this API use a timestamp value, the following formats are supported:\nISO 8601 combined date and time with timezone of the format below where “Z” is offset from UTC like “-03”, “+1245”, or just “Z” which is UTC (0 offset);\nYYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ssZ YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss.SSSZ Milliseconds since Unix Epoch\nA compatible value can be generated using the toISOString or toValue method on a Javascript Date object.\nExamples\n2011-10-10T14:48:00-0300 2016-07-01T13:48:24+00:00 2016-07-01T13:48:24Z 1467383343484 (MS since Epoch)","3x-api#3.x API":"For 3.x deployments credentials are stored in CouchDB configuration in a custom medic-credentials section.\nTo add the credential to the admin config you need to PUT the value using curl, for example, to set a credential with key “mykey” and password “my pass” use the following command.\ncurl -X PUT https://:@/_node/_local/_config/medic-credentials/mykey -d '\"my pass\"' You can also add it via Fauxton:\nNavigate to the Config screen at https:///_utils/#/_config Click Add Option The Section should be medic-credentials, the Name should be (in this example) mykey and the value should be the password Click Create You should then be able to see your credential in the list of configuration shown","bulk-operations#Bulk Operations":"","contact#Contact":"","contacts-by-phone#Contacts by phone":"Added in 3.10.0\nAccepts a phone number parameter and returns fully hydrated contacts that match the requested phone number.

Instead, the user must log in using the “Login with SSO” button.\nWhen creating/editing users via the App Management interface, the “SSO Email Address” field is used to set the oidc_username property.\n(Note: it is possible to have a mixed environment where some users log in with SSO and others log in with other authentication methods.

Accessing this link, before its expiration time, will log the user in directly - without the need of any other credentials. The link can only be accessed once, the token becomes invalid after being used for one login. The token expires in 24 hours, after which logging in is only possible by either generating a new token, or disabling token_login and manually setting a password.\nThe SMS messages are stored in a doc of a new type login_token. These docs cannot be viewed as reports from the webapp, and can only be edited by admins, but their messages are visible in the Admin Message Queue page.\nTo disable login by SMS for a user, update the user sending token_login with a false value.

Added in 4.3.0 validPhone(field) Returns true if the field is a valid phone number else returns false. Added in 4.3.1 uniqueWithin(*fields, time_period) Same as unique but the last argument is the time period in which to search. Eg uniqueWithin('form', 'patient_id', '1 week') checks that the same form wasn’t submitted for this patient in the past week. exists(form_id, field) Returns true if a report matches the form_id and value for field. This is useful to check that a patient was registered for a service before reporting about it. Eg exists('REG', 'patient_id') checks that a REG form was already submitted for a patient. As of 2.12 most uses of this function are obsolete because checking for a valid patient_id is done automatically by the accept_patient_report transition using registration_not_found in the messages.event_type. isISOWeek(weekFieldName[, yearFieldName]) Returns true if the current report has a week value that is less or equal to the number of ISO weeks of the current year or the year value of the same report. The first parameter is the field name for the week and the second parameter is the field name for the year: isISOWeek('week', 'year'). If the second parameter is not specified, then the current year is used: isISOWeek('week'). isAfter(duration) Returns true if the date property comes after today plus the duration. For this to work, the property should be a date type. e.g. isAfter('2 weeks') checks that the date property is at least two weeks in the future from today. Negative values are also supported. isBefore(duration) Returns true if the date property comes before today minus the duration. For this to work, the property should be a date type. e.g. isBefore('2 weeks') checks that the date property is at least two weeks in the past from today. Negative values are also supported.","sample-usage#Sample usage":"To ensure the patient_id is 5 digits and not already registered.\n[ { \"property\": \"patient_id\", \"rule\": \"regex(\\d{5}) \u0026\u0026 unique('patient_id')\", \"translation_key\": \"patient_id_invalid\" } ] For case-insensitive comparison, use iEquals function, and you can use || for logical OR.

For example, to say a field is only valid if the value has at least five characters, you would use the lenMin(5). They are used in registrations[].validations.list[].rule and patient_reports[].validations.list[].rule to determine if an incoming report is accepted. A report is accepted as valid only if all rules return true. If any validation rule returns false then the report is marked as invalid, and a message is automatically sent to the submitter. The content for the message is set in the translation_key associated to each rule. If a report fails multiple validations then each message will be sent. These can be combined into a single SMS by specifying \"*.validations.join_responses\" : true.\nThe syntax aims to mimic C-like languages. You can use logical operators, ternaries, nested “blocks” (rule \u0026\u0026 (some || nested || rules)) and validation functions (validationFunction(\"arg1\", \"arg2\")).\nString parameters for validation functions, such as the regex in the “regex” function, should be quoted.\nNon-quoted parameters will be cast to floats (numbers with decimals).\nFor each validation function, there is also a matching function prepended by other that allows you to run functions on other values than the one the rule string is for. This can be useful for fields that have differing requirements depending on another field. For example:\n{ \"state\": \"otherEquals('country', 'US') ? lenMin(2) : lenMin(0)\" } This rule validates the length state property if the country is set to “US”, but skips validation otherwise.\nValidation function arguments can be either strings or numerical values. Numerical arguments should not be wrapped in quotation marks or apostrophes: lenMin(5).","variables#Variables":"Outgoing messages can use Mustache templating to insert variables and specify data formats.

These transitions can be used to generate a short form patient id or assign a report to a facility.\nHow transitions work A transition is a Javascript code that runs when a document is changed. A transition can edit the changed doc or do anything server-side code can do for that matter.\nTransitions are run in series, not in parallel:\nFor a given change, you can expect one transition to be finished before the next runs.\nYou can expect one change to be fully processed by all transitions before the next starts being processed.\nTransitions obey the following rules:\nhas a filter({ id, doc, info }) function that accepts the changed document as an argument and returns true if it needs to run/be applied.\na onMatch({ id, doc, info }) function that will run on changes that pass the filter. Should return true when the transition has run successfully.\ncan have an init() function to do any required setup and throw Errors on invalid configuration.\nIt is not necessary for an individual transition to save the changes made to doc to the DB, the doc will be saved once all the transitions have been edited. If an individual transition saves the document provided at doc, it takes responsibility for re-attaching the newly saved document (with new seq etc) at doc\nguarantees the consistency of a document.\nruns serially and in specific order. A transition is free to make async calls but the next transition will only run after the previous transition’s match function executed. If your transition is dependent on another transition, it should be sorted so it runs after the dependee transition.\nis repeatable, it can run multiple times on the same document without negative effect. You can use the transitions property on a document’s infodoc to determine if a transition has run.\nRegardless of whether the doc is saved or not, the transitions will all be run (unless one crashes).\nWhen your transition encounters an error, there are different ways to deal with it. You can :\nfinish your transition by throwing an error that has a truthy changed property. This will save the error to doc. finish your transition by throwing an error. The error will be logged to the sentinel log. This will not save the error on the doc, so there will be no record that this transition ran. That particular change will not go through transitions again, but if the same doc has another change in the future since there is no record of the erroring transition having run, it will be rerun. crash sentinel. When sentinel restarts, since that change did not record successful processing, it will be reprocessed. Transitions that did not save anything to the doc will be rerun. Configuration By default all transitions are disabled. They can be enabled by configuring the transitions property to have a key with the transitions name and a truthy value. As of version 3.12.0 some transitions will partially run on the client for offline users. To opt out from client-side transitions, add a \"client_side: false\" property to the transition configuration.\n{ \"transitions\": { \"a\": { }, \"b\": true, \"c\": { \"disable\": false }, \"d\": { \"disable\": true }, \"e\": { \"client_side\": false } } } In the example above, the d transition will not be applied, a, b c will be applied on the server and on the client, while e will only be applied on the server.\nAvailable transitions The following transitions are available and executed in order.\nKey Description maintain_info_document Records metadata about the document such as when it was replicated. Enabled by default. update_clinics Adds a contact’s info to a new data record. This is used to attribute an incoming SMS message or report to the appropriate contact. The rc_code value on the contact is used to match to the value of the form field set as the facility_reference in the JSON form definition. This matching is useful when reports are sent on behalf of a facility by unknown or various phone numbers. If facility_reference is not set for a form, the contact match is attempted using the sender’s phone number. If a form is not public and a match is not found then the sys.facility_not_found error is raised. A message will be sent out whenever this error is raised. registration For registering a patient or place to a schedule.

Previously this only added a patient_id to the root of the registration form. This functionality has been merged into add_patient. Now, using this event will result in the same functionality as described in add_patient above.\nadd_expected_date add_birth_date assign_schedule clear_schedule add_place as of 3.8.0 Sets the place_id on the root of the registration document and creates the place doc with the provided type.\nBy default, the created place would have the same parent as the submitter.

Adds a muting_history entry to Sentinel info docs for every updated contact Updates all connected registrations (for the target contact and descendants), changing the state of all unsent scheduled_tasks to muted Unsent scheduled_tasks have either a scheduled or pending state Updates the contact’s client-side muting_history to set the last_update property to server_side and update the server_side section with the current date and muted state. If the report was processed client-side, all “following” muting/unmuting events that have affected the same contacts will be replayed. This means the transition could end up running multiple times over the same report. Replaying is required due to how PouchDB \u003c-\u003e CouchDB synchronization does not respect the order in which the documents have been created, to ensure that contacts end up in the correct muted state. Unmuting action Updates the target contact’s topmost muted ancestor and all its descendants, removing the muted property. Because the muted state is inherited, unmuting cascades upwards to the highest level muted ancestor. If none of the ancestors is muted, unmuting cascades downwards only.\nClient-side Added in 3.12.0\nClient-side unmuting runs offline on a user’s device. Only the contacts and reports available on the device will be updated.\nAdds/updates the muting_history property on every updated contact, sets the last known server-side state of the contact and sets the last_update property to client_side Updates the report doc to add a client_side_transitions property to track which transitions have run client-side Server-side Server-side unmuting runs as a typical Sentinel transition.

Muting history Server-side muting history Each time the muted state of a contact changes, an entry is added to a muting_history list saved in Sentinel info docs (stored as an array property with the same name). Entries in muting_history contain the following information:\nProperty Description muted Boolean representing the muted state date Date in ISO Format report_id An _id reference to the report that triggered the action Client-side muting history Added in 3.12.0\nEach time the client changes the muted state of a contact, an entry is added to a muting_history property on the contact’s doc. The last_update entry is also changed to client_side. The muting_history property contains the following information:\nProperty Values Description last_update server_side or client_side Updated every time a service updates the contact, with the corresponding value server_side Object server_side.muted true or false Last known server-side muting state server_side.date Date in ISO format Last known server-side muting/unmuting date client_side Array Client-side muting/unmuting events list. New events are pushed at the end of this list and it should never be re-ordered. The list represents the “chronological” order in which the reports that triggered muting were created. client_side[].muted true or false Client-side muting state client_side[].date Date in ISO format Client-side muting/unmuting date client_side[].report_id uuid The uuid of the muting/unmuting report that triggered the update Configuration Configuration is stored in the muting field of app_settings.json.\nProperty Description mute_forms An array of form codes which will trigger muting. Required unmute_forms An array of form codes which will trigger unmuting. Optional. validations List of form fields validations. All mute \u0026 unmute forms will be subjected to these validation rules. Invalid forms will not trigger muting/unmuting actions. Optional. messages List of tasks/errors that will be created, determined by event_type. Optional. Important\nContact forms cannot trigger muting or unmuting, but any data_record that has a form property (typically a Report) can.\nSupported events_types are:\nEvent Type Trigger mute On successful mute action unmute On successful unmute action already_muted On mute action, when target contact is already muted already_unmuted On unmute action, when target contact is already unmuted contact_not_found Either mute or unmute actions when target contact is not found Note\nWhen muting events are processed both client-side and server-side, there is no guarantee that the state of the database will be the same between the two processing events. Some possible cases where the data is changed in significant ways, that will affect the final muting state are:\nupdated muting settings between client and server processing of the same report / contact editing the muting/unmuting reports before they are synced, but after the transition ran locally, that either change the target contact or change the validity of the report deleting muting/unmuting reports before they are synced validation rules that depend on database data (for example using the “exists” rule, which will run over different data sets, a report could be valid for the client but invalid for the server and the other way around). conflicts that overwrite muting_history for contacts delayed sync for some docs (either contacts or reports) could exacerbate the above because of the “replay” behavior.

Example \"registrations\": [{ \"form\": \"8\", \"events\": [{ \"name\": \"on_create\", \"trigger\": \"add_case\" }] }], \"accept_case_reports\": [{ \"form\": \"SIGNOFF\", \"validations\": {}, \"messages\": [{ \"event_type\": \"report_accepted\", \"bool_expr\": \"some expression\", \"message\": \"some message\", \"recipient\": \"some recipients\" }] }] self_report Updates a data_record to set its patient to its sender. The resulting doc will have fields.patient_uuid and fields.patient_id filled with the sender’s information. Provides hydrated patient information to subsequent transitions. The sender is the contact associated with the phone number that sent the original SMS.\nIf a doc already contains a patient field, does not have a sender or its form is not configured to be enabled for this transition, it will be ignored.\nConfiguration Configuration is stored in the self_report field of app_settings.json as a list of objects connecting forms to messages. Every object should have this structure:\nProperty Description form Form code. Required messages List of tasks/errors that will be created, determined by event_type. Optional. Supported events_types are:\nEvent Type Trigger report_accepted On successful sender updating sender_not_found Sender not found Example \"self_report\": [ { \"form\": \"FORM\", \"messages\": [ { \"event_type\": \"report_accepted\", \"recipient\": \"reporting_unit\", \"translation_key\": \"messages.form.report_accepted\" }, { \"event_type\": \"sender_not_found\", \"recipient\": \"reporting_unit\", \"translation_key\": \"messages.form.sender_not_found\" } ] }, { \"form\": \"OTHER\", \"messages\": [ { \"event_type\": \"report_accepted\", \"recipient\": \"reporting_unit\", \"translation_key\": \"messages.other.report_accepted\" }, { \"event_type\": \"sender_not_found\", \"recipient\": \"reporting_unit\", \"translation_key\": \"messages.other.sender_not_found\" } ] } ] update_clinics Adds a contact’s info to a data record so as to attribute an incoming SMS message or report to the appropriate contact.\nConfiguration As of version 3.12 you can add configuration to send a message whenever a contact match fails while running this transition. Configuration is stored in the update_clinics field of app_settings.json as a list of objects connecting forms to messages. Every object should have this structure:\nProperty Description form Form code. messages List of tasks/errors that will be created, determined by event_type. Supported events_types are:\nEvent Type Trigger sys.facility_not_found Facility not found If this configuration is not set then the message defaults to what is set in the messages.generic.sys.facility_not_found key.\nExample \"update_clinics\": [ { \"form\": \"FORM\", \"messages\": [ { \"event_type\": \"sys.facility_not_found\", \"recipient\": \"reporting_unit\", \"translation_key\": \"sys.facility_not_found\" } ] }, { \"form\": \"OTHER\", \"messages\": [ { \"event_type\": \"sys.facility_not_found\", \"recipient\": \"reporting_unit\", \"translation_key\": \"messages.other.facility_not_found\" } ] } ] create_user_for_contacts Users are automatically created for certain contacts. Both creating a new user for a new contact and replacing an existing user with a new user are supported.\nConfiguration Several configurations are required in app_settings to enable the create_user_for_contacts transition.\nLogin by SMS must be enabled by setting the token_login configuration.\nThe app_url property must be set to the URL of the application. This is used to generate the token login link for the new user.\nExample \"app_url\": \"https://demo.app.medicmobile.org\", \"token_login\": { \"enabled\": true, \"translation_key\": \"sms.token.login.help\" }, \"transitions\": { \"create_user_for_contacts\": true } When adding a new person contact, the create_user_for_contacts transition can be triggered to create a new user associated with that contact. Available since 4.2.x.\nExample scenario A supervisor can onboard a CHW just by creating a new person contact for the CHW with a “create contact” form.\nOnce the new contact is synced with the server and has been processed by Sentinel, a user will be automatically created and the new CHW will receive an SMS message (at the phone number specified in the contact) containing a token login link. This link will allow them to login as the newly created user. For security reasons, the token login link is valid for only one use and can only be used within 24 hours.\nForm Configuration When the create_user_for_contacts transition is enabled, Sentinel will attempt to create a user for any newly created person contacts with the user_for_contact.create field set to 'true'. So, contact forms and app forms for adding persons that should trigger new user creation need to include a user_for_contact group that contains a create field. The calculation for the value of the create field should evaluate to 'true' when a new user is desired. Any other value for that field will not trigger user creation.\nOnce Sentinel has generated a user for the contact, the user_for_contact.create field will be automatically removed from the contact document.\nUsers are only generated for newly created contacts. Editing an existing contact will not trigger user creation regardless of the value set for the user_for_contact.create field.\nRequired contact fields The new person contacts must have the following fields set:\nname phone - must be set to a valid number roles - must contain the desired roles for the new user (if just a single role is needed, the role field on the contact may be used instead) See the person-create contact form provided in the Default config as an example. This form will trigger the creation of a new user for the contact when the role is set to chw or chw_supervisor and a phone number is provided.\nReplace User An existing offline user can be replaced on a device so that a new user can use that device without needing to immediately sync with the server.

After that, the supervisor can give the device to the new CHW, and they can begin using it.\nSubsequent reports submitted on the device by the new CHW will be associated with the new contact. When the device is eventually able to synchronize with the server, it will be automatically logged out so the transition to the new user can be completed.

This means technically they can be used to do things like manipulating the DOM for fine-grained control of how elements are displayed in a form.\nAdvanced integrations like this are not explicitly supported (they may break in future versions of the CHT). However, they can be a powerful tool for developers looking to extend the CHT without having to fork the entire project.\nSee this blog post from a community member for more information and inspiration on the kinds of things that can be achieved with extension libs!","cht-api#CHT API":"The function will now be available via the CHT API for tasks, targets, and contact summary configurations.","cht-xpath-functions#CHT xPath functions":"To execute the function from within an xform use the cht:extension-lib xpath function.","introduction#Introduction":"Extension libraries are blocks of code that are cached with the CHT web application giving app developers a powerful tool to extend the CHT. This is an advanced feature and requires an app developer with some software development experience.\nAn example of a use for this feature is to provide a function to calculate a risk score based on a machine learning model. The function can then be called passing in values from app forms and return the result to be stored with the report.","invoking-the-function#Invoking the function":"","library#Library":"The first step is to create the js file to return the function that will be called by the web application. Create a new file using this template:\nmodule.exports = function(/* parameters */) { return result; } Now populate the function as needed. For complex functions, it is recommended to use third party libraries (such as momentjs, lodash, etc) and use a bundler (eg: webpack) to make it easy to build a single file. It’s recommended to use development best practices such as linting, unit tests, and minification to ensure quality and small download size.","uploading-to-the-cht#Uploading to the CHT":"Create a folder within the project configuration to contain the libraries, for example:\n./extension-libs average.js calculate-risk-score.js Now run the command: cht upload-extension-libs\nThis will create or update a document to CouchDB with an ID of extension-libs with each of the configured scripts attached. Once this is created the webapp service worker will be updated so the libraries are cached on the phone ready for use offline.","xpath-functions#xpath functions":"To call the function from within a form the parameters and return value will need to have a very specific structure to work with Enketo xforms.\n{ \"t\": , \"v\": } Where the type is one of “bool”, “num”, “str”, “date”, or “arr”. For example, to calculate the average of two inputs, you would use:\nconst getValue = function(obj) { let val; if (obj.t === 'arr') { val = obj.v \u0026\u0026 obj.v.length \u0026\u0026 obj.v[0]; } else { val = obj.v; } if (!val) { return 0; } const parsed = parseInt(val.textContent); return isNaN(parsed) ? 0 : parsed; }; module.exports = function(first, second) { const average = (getValue(first) + getValue(second)) / 2; return { t: 'num', v: average }; }"},"title":"extension-libs/"},"/building/reports/":{"data":{"":"Content in this section Overview Defining reports"},"title":"Reports"},"/building/reports/defining-reports/":{"data":{"":"The reports shown in your app are the completed and submitted forms.

To reset the filters and view the full list of forms, click on “Reset” located in the filter sidebar.\nNote\nA new user experience for Filter and Search was introduced in v3.17. The previous version can be re-enabled for users by adding the permission can_view_old_filter_and_search to the user’s role; however, the old version should be considered deprecated and will be completely removed in a future release.

The second line of text is the name of the report, and the third line of text is the hierarchy of place to which that person belongs. In the upper right corner, a timestamp displays when the report was submitted. Reports are sorted by submission date, with the most recent reports at the top. If a report is unread, the timestamp will be bold blue and there will be a horizontal blue line above it.\nApps built with the Core Framework have a “review” feature that allows managers to indicate whether a report has been reviewed and if it contains errors. If a manager has marked a report as “correct,” a green checkmark will show below the timestamp. If a report is marked as “has errors,” a red ‘X’ will show.

It presents Supervisors with actionable information about their CHWs, by aggregating data for each of the CHWs that a Supervisor manages and presenting it in an easily digestible format. This enables Supervisors to gain insight into how well their team of CHWs is working together to meet common goals.\nSelecting an aggregate widget opens the detailed view with the data for each individual CHW. If a CHW is performing below the target goal, their value will be highlighted in red, making it easier for Supervisors to know with which CHWs to follow up for coaching and performance management.\nNote\nAggregate targets were introduced in v3.9, and can be configured for both online and offline users. Aggregate targets are based on the widgets seen by CHWs, and dependent on the data that has been synced. If a CHW or the supervisor has not synced, then the aggregate target will not be up to date.","filtering-aggregate-targets#Filtering Aggregate Targets":"The ability for one user to manage multiple areas / facilities was introduced in v4.9.0. With that change it was important for users who manage multiple areas to filter aggregate targets by the respective facilities.

The example user in this illustration manages two facilities: First Health Facility and Second Health Facility.\nThis is the landing page for the Aggregate Targets for a user who manages multiple areas / facilities.\nThe name of the facility appears in the breadcrumbs of the aggregate widgets on the Left Hand Side list and underneath the Target Title.\nOn the Top Right the user can click the Filter button to open the sidebar and change the Aggregate Targets of the other facilities.\nClicking the Filter button opens the sidebar, which allows the user to filter the Aggregate Targets by Facility or Reporting Period\nSelecting the Second Health Facility in the filter updates the Facility name in the breadcrumbs of the aggregate widgets on the Left Hand Side list and underneath the Target Title.\nFiltering the Aggregate Targets by Reporting Period adds the name of the previous month to the breadcrumbs of the aggregate widgets on the Left Hand Side list and in the Target details.\nUsers who manage one area / facility can only filter their Aggregate Targets by Reporting Period.\nThe name of the facility does not appear in the breadcrumbs of the aggregate widgets on the Left Hand Side list or underneath the Target Title.\nFiltering the Aggregate Targets by Reporting Period adds the name of the previous month to the breadcrumbs of the aggregate widgets on the Left Hand Side list and in the Target Details.\nNote\nThe list of facilities in the sidebar are sorted in alphabetic order. The default filter option for the facilities filter is the first facility in the sorted array of user Facilities. The default filter option for the reporting period is This month.

By tapping on a target, they can also see each CHW’s contribution towards that total. Once the Supervisor has verified data accuracy with CHWs, they can communicate with Health Records Information Officers to feed data into the national health information system.\nDHIS2 integration was introduced in v3.9.","supervisor-dashboards#Supervisor Dashboards":"Program dashboards track, visualize, and share health progress with stakeholders more broadly. Supervisors can use program dashboards to help articulate their CHW cohorts activities and how they align with program impact standards and indicators. Summary statistics of CHW service area performance (e.g. number of home visits, number of protocol errors, etc) help to identify areas for continued improvement and deeper audits of care data.\nThe data that can be visualized is highly configurable, and depends on what data fields are configured in a particular CHT app’s forms. Dashboards can be built using any software that supports visualizing data with the widely used PostgreSQL database. Examples include the open source tool Superset, as well as proprietary technologies like Klipfolio and Tableau."},"title":"Dashboards and Reporting"},"/building/supervision/supervision-overview/":{"data":{"":"Supervision and workforce management are important aspects to building and maintaining high-performing community health systems. Supervisors help Community Health Workers deliver quality healthcare services to their patients through building CHW care delivery knowledge and skills, fostering a supportive work environment, and supporting continuity of care between home-based care and community health centers or facilities.\nThe importance of regular and systematic CHW supervision is emphasized by the WHO’s guidelines on health policy and system support, which is formulated to optimize community-based health worker programs. Following these guidelines, the CHT is designed to enable Supervisors to provide personalized performance feedback during CHW supervision as well as track aggregate statistics.

A video demonstration of setting up a multi-facility user and what this looks like from a user’s perspective can be found on the forum and in the June 2024 CHT Round-up.","user-management#User Management":"Supervisors are able to set up users in the CHT without contacting a system administrator. They can create new CHW user accounts or replace CHWs on an existing device.\nWhen creating a new user account, Supervisors fill out the necessary details, including the CHW’s phone number, from their own device. They can do this while offline, but must sync before the actual user account is created. Once the Supervisor syncs, the CHT will send an SMS to the new CHW with a magic link that enables them to login and start using the app.\nWhen replacing a CHW, Supervisors access the existing device and provide details about the new CHW. The new CHW can start using the app immediately, even while offline, and will see all of the existing household data. Once the new CHW syncs, the records on the server will be updated to reflect the new CHWs details.\nThis can be used to manage both CHW and CHW supervisor roles."},"title":"User and Area Management"},"/building/targets/":{"data":{"":"Content in this section Overview Target Widgets targets.js"},"title":"Targets"},"/building/targets/target-widgets/":{"data":{"":"This tutorial will take you through how to build target widgets.\nTarget widgets provide a summary or analysis of the data in submitted reports.\nYou will be adding target widgets that will allow Community Health Workers (CHWs) to track various metrics based on assessment reports submitted.","1-define-an-all-time-target-widget#1.

When defining tasks, all the data about contacts on the device (both people and places) along with all their reports are available. Tasks are available only for users of type “restricted to their place”. Tasks can pull in fields from reports and pass data as inputs to the form that opens when the task is selected, enabling richer user experiences.\nTask generation occurs on the client periodically and creates documents which track the status of the task over time. To avoid performance issues the developer needs to be conscious about generating too many tasks. For example, to remind a user to do something every day, you could generate one task for each day and fill up the user’s device. The recommended approach is to only generate the tasks for the near future, or only once the previous task is resolved.

The training instance should have the same configuration as the production instance, and have users created for training. To differentiate the Android app used for training from the production one, create a duplicate of your flavor and modify the following aspects\nBorder \u0026 Message: Consider adding a distinctive border and message when using the training app. This can be done by setting the build config field IS_TRAINING_APP to true, as seen in build.gradle for the training version of the Gamma app. CHT Instance: In your flavor’s res/values/strings.xml file set the app_host string to be the URL of your training instance, as seen in the Gamma Training app. If left the same as the production app both training and production data will end up in your production instance. Launcher icons: Consider using completely different icons, or at least change the color of the launcher icons. App name: Provide a noticeably different name to the training app. Since app names are often cut short on Android devices, make the change at beginning of the text. For example, CHW App [TRAINING VERSION] may display as CHW App... so it would be better to use [TRAINING] CHW App. The app name is set in the flavor’s res/values/strings.xml file, as seen in the Gamma training app. App ID: If you want to allow both apps to be on a device at once you will need to make sure your training app has a different applicationId, as seen in build.gradle for the Gamma training app. Note\nKeeping the applicationId values the same will make it impossible to have both the training and production apps installed at the same time on a device. If you have a way to install the production app after the training is complete then you may choose to do this to prevent users from using the wrong app.","switching-from-training-to-production-app#Switching from training to production app":"To avoid having production data in the training app, it is encouraged to remove the training app from the device once training is complete.\nIf the production app can always be installed after the use of the training is complete, then using the same applicationId guarantees that only one of the apps is installed at any given time.\nChanging passwords for the training users in an attempt to lock them out is not recommended. In some circumstances a user would be able to continue to use the training app for production use and not have the data sync back to the server.\nIt is preferable to remove the training app from devices, and monitor the training instance for unexpected activity that can be brought over to the production instance if needed."},"title":"Onboarding"},"/building/training/securely-onboarding-users-at-scale/":{"data":{"":"This document shows how to achieve a high level of credential management security for a CHT deployment.

Per the note above, changing a password will log the user out immediately unless they are offline. Having supervisors encourage a user to switch their device to offline mode (turn off all data) is a good way to ensure they can continue to deliver care so they’re not locked out.","example-scenarios#Example scenarios":"","frequently-asked-questions#Frequently Asked Questions":"Best practices for user management at scale? Is it possible to send Magic Link to users using their own mobile bundles instead of setting up a messaging gateway?","ideal-practice-1-only-magic-links#Ideal practice 1: Only Magic Links":"Create a spreadsheet with all your users’ data. Included is a username but NOT a password. When users are created in bulk via the command line or bulk user upload, have a token login sent to the user via an SMS gateway. This avoids the problem of passwords being stored in clear text in the spreadsheet or on a printed version. The token login links can only be used once and are only valid for 24 hours.","ideal-practice-2-unknown-passwords-reset-during-provision#Ideal practice 2: Unknown passwords, reset during provision":"An alternate and also secure approach, is to bulk create the users as described above, not use magic links, and use random passwords that you do not save after giving users the credentials. Train the users on changing their password after they’ve logged in for the first time. This makes it harder for a password to be leaked because the password list isn’t kept. Additionally, as users are trained to change their password, a leaked list is likely not useful as all passwords have changed.","programmatic-password-reset#Programmatic password reset":"Medic has published a script to easily change all passwords for a list of users. Administrators will then be responsible to log CHWs back in by securely sending them their password.\nAdditionally, this script could be updated to immediately send a token login link to the user. There would be no need to change the password as this is done automatically for you. Note that users would need their phone numbers recorded in the CHT to receive a token login link. Here’s an example curl command to send a token login link for the mary user:\ncurl https://medic:password@cht.example.com/api/v1/users/mary \\ -X POST -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\ -d '{\"token_login\":true}'","remediation-of-security-failure#Remediation of security failure":"By knowing what the security threats are you can know the most helpful steps to remediate them to limit the damage done to the CHT deployment, the privacy of the patients and the security of CHWs.\nNote\nUsers who have their password changed can continue to use the CHT to deliver care. They need to keep their device offline though. After a password change, when a CHW attempts to sync, they will be prompted to log in. At that point, they will not be able to continue using the CHT until they log in. No data will be lost if they log in as the same user.","secure-administrative-users#Secure administrative users":"CHT administrators have the ability to create and delete users and push new configurations to the CHT so they should take extra precautions in managing their password. They should use a strong passphrase (instead of a password) that is unique to their CHT login. They should use a password manager to store this passphrase. By following these steps, unauthorized people are less likely to be able to access administrator accounts.","secure-devices#Secure devices":"Firstly, ensure that the CHWs’ devices are secure: they all employ disk encryption and require a password or PIN to unlock and use. See our Securing Android Devices document for more information. As well, an MDM may be used to enforce disk encryption and device unlock protocols.","secure-passwords#Secure passwords":"When generating passwords for CHWs, do not use a formula which repeats itself (eg password123 for user A, password234 for user B etc.). Do not use the CHW information such as username, email or phone number in the password. Train CHWs to not re-use passwords.\nFor a reference application showing secure password generation, see generatePassword() in the CHT Core scripts directory. This will generate a truly random 14 character password with uppercase (A-Z), lowercase (a-z), numerical (0-9) and one special character (-).\nTo generate a password that is easier to remember, type and speak over a phone, consider using Diceware passphrases. For added accessibility, use a word list from the CHWs native language if it is not English. This will make the words easier to spell and more likely to be remembered, but still secure.","spreadsheet-use#Spreadsheet use":"Most deployments manage users in a spreadsheet shared either in Google Docs or other cloud service. It is convenient to have a canonical shared location to access the data. This is an acceptable, but not ideal, solution as it ensures changes are instantly shared while still ensuring a number of key security requirements. For an ideal solution, see “Ideal” below.\nOf paramount importance:\nNever enable anonymous access to the URL for the spreadsheet. You must always require authentication to access user credential lists Audit regularly who has access to the shared spreadsheet. Consider setting up an alert every time a new person is granted access Reduce the total number of users that need access by breaking up user lists by logical group. For example, each sub-county could have its own user spreadsheet. That way the user credentials are only shared with the local administrators who need it Refrain from printing spreadsheets of users and passwords. They can be lost, stolen or easily photographed when shown in public If you ever need to download a plaintext CSV with username and password, ensure the computer also has disk encryption enabled and requires a password to unlock Do not keep downloaded CSV plaintext copies of credentials. Instead, delete and re-download them from the authorized, authenticated cloud server as needed","transmitting-credentials#Transmitting credentials":"When it comes time get a username and password onto a device or to a remote user, be sure to use mediums that are secure. One of the main concerns is credentials being found long after they were sent.\nA best practice is for the sender to add a credential to a shared password manager. The person receiving the credentials can then securely open the password manager. If no password manager is available, consider sending the password via One Time Secret To send credentials in to many CHWs, consider using token login. For sending large lists of credentials, as mentioned above, using a cloud provider like Google Sheets, is a good way to have an audit trail and still provide easy, remote access.","worst-practice-shared-list-anonymous-access-similar-passwords#Worst practice: Shared list, anonymous access, similar passwords":"Create all users with near identical passwords (eg password123, passord234, password345 etc.) that are then printed out, shared via email or posted to a public URL which requires no authentication.

For most deployments, program leads and ministry of health officials may also need training for them to perform their roles, oversee and supervise the community health programs. End user training needs to be well planned and implemented using standardized training methods and approaches which take into account the capacity of end users.\nFor most community health programs, CHW training is divided into two major sections consisting of basic modules and technical modules. For basic module training, CHWs are trained on basic skills such as leadership, communication and counselling, basic health promotion practices and basic lifesaving skills. For technical training, end users are trained in the following common areas to help improve their skills and delivery:\nThematic training - this training focuses on the health program areas of interest, this will vary from one program to another depending on the specific health areas users are expected to support. For example, for an MNCH program, users will be trained in ANC, PNC and immunization. Hardware and software training - users are trained on how they can operate an android phone, reboot the hardware, install and reinstall applications and how they can log into the CHT app. This training is critical for end users who have never interacted with a smart phone before. CHT tool training - this involves training users on how they can use different CHT tools (SMS, mobile and web applications) to guide them to deliver health care services. Skill development - users are trained on interpersonal communication, listening skills, capacity building skills and how they can promote healthy behaviour change. Behavioural - the users are taught how to build relations in the community and how to work within diverse communities. Proper training of health care workers leads to increased job satisfaction ensuring health care workers are able to provide high quality care.\nThis guide highlights some of the considerations and steps for planning and conducting end user training. It is based on the learnings from many collaborative trainings that have been conducted over the years. Some of the training resources have been co-created with various implementing partners and ministries of health. This guide can help partners learn how they can plan and conduct training.\nThe CHT training process comprises a series of steps highlighted below that need to be followed systematically to ensure an efficient training programme.\nTraining needs assessment - this is the first step prior to conducting the training to help understand the users needs, behaviour, roles and how they perform their responsibilities. At this stage, information on the literacy and numerical skills of end users, demographics (age, gender, language of instruction), potential program champions is collected, this information helps inform the training approach, duration and methods of training. To collect the needs assessment information, various methods can be used including observation, interviews,focused group discussions and surveys. Define the training objectives - In this step, the training outcomes are defined, these are things end users should be able to do as a result of the training. Develop a training plan or checklist - The checklist lists the tasks, activities and resources needed to train the end users Create the training materials and resources Conduct the training - Different training approaches can be adopted. Training can be done in person or virtually. It includes direct training of end users, training of trainers (ToT) model which involves training program champions to cascade the training, use of CHT training cards in which users are able to access training resources in-app, remote online training and self learning through a learning management system. Evaluate the training - In this stage, the training outcomes are assessed to determine if the training has achieved the expected outcomes. The learning objectives will help to determine the evaluation process that would be most appropriate. Pre training preparation Before training is done, a training preparation checklist is prepared to ensure all items listed below are catered to.","cht-training-process#CHT training process":"","conducting-a-training#Conducting a training":"Training should be approached in a cohesive and integrated manner, starting with the initial training of the end users, followed by regular refresher training, with continuous support, supervision and mentorship. Training is usually carried out collaboratively by the implementing partners, ministry of health officials and project implementers.\nDifferent training approaches can be used to train end users. Several factors determine the training approach that is to be used, this includes the number of trainees and facilitators, user demographics, learning objectives, training environment and the available resources. The training approaches include: the training of trainers (ToT) model, direct end-user training and remote training. The ToT model is used to train a large pool of end users. For this model, a cadre of end users are trained as ToTs and after the training they are expected to cascade, reinforce and support the training of other end users. Direct training involves a trainer conducting an in-person training of end users while for the remote training, end users are trained online or they can access the training resources on their devices.","evaluation#Evaluation":"Evaluation assesses whether the training objectives have been achieved. Evaluation of the training involves assessing the effect of the training observed against a set standard considered as an indication of learning. A common model used to evaluate the training consists of the following four levels:\nLevel 1 - this is the participants reaction towards the learning usually performed through a feedback survey, participants can evaluate the training content, facilitators, training approaches and the training venue. Trainers use this feedback to improve the training content and approach Level 2 - This measures what learners have learnt and what they are able to perform as a result of the training. This can be done during the training through pre and post tests, simulations, practical tests and tasks Level 3 - After the training event, the learners are evaluated if they are able to apply what they have learned when working. This can be done through observations, learning and interviews Level 4 - This is concerned with the extent to which changes in behaviour after the training contribute to improved results and increased impact. This can be done after a series of training and refresher trainings and it requires before and after the training comparison","logistics#Logistics":"Identify the total number of participants. It is recommended that the ratio of facilitators to participants should be 1:10 and each training class should have a maximum of 30 participants. Confirm and organize training venue. The venue should be well ventilated, have adequate lighting, good sanitation and security and be at a central location for easy access. It is recommended that the training of the CHWs takes place in a community setting such as schools, churches or mosques while training of CHAs and program teams can happen in a facility or hotel. Phone preparation Procure phones for the training with minimum specs requirements Ensure phones are fully charged prior to training Guide users on how to obtain and register SIM cards Load airtime into phones Pack phones, chargers and any other applicable hardware to take to the training venue Prepare the inventory with end-users names, SIM numbers and phone IMEI numbers Prepare the mobile and SIM handover form with a documented mobile and SIM Management guideline handout Confirm availability of electricity, mobile network and internet at the training venue Invite the partner or ministry of health to lead the training Organize a facilitators pre-planning meeting to assign each facilitator sessions they will be covering. Facilitators should visit the training site prior to the training to make sure the site is ready for the planned training. Organize and process payment forms, if applicable, for: Trainer and co-trainer allowance Participation allowance Travel allowance for participants Venue costs and other expenses","post-training-activities#Post training activities":"After every day of training, facilitators should conduct training evaluation to discuss what went well and the areas to improve on the subsequent training days. After the completion of the training, ministries of health, implementing partners and CHT users agree on a date when the project can go live. Below are the critical activities that take place before go-live.\nParticipants are informed when the project will go live. In most cases, the project goes live a few weeks after the training Participants are trained on how to install the production application Paricipants are reminded to uninstall the training application User accounts are created on the production instance and credentials shared Users are informed on technical support structure to support with post-training issues Users are sensitized on privacy and security best practices","pre-training-preparation#Pre training preparation":"","tech-preparation#Tech preparation":"Set up application instance (training \u0026 production instances) Create user accounts for all personas depending on the specific project Set up users’ phones to ensure applications like Playstore and other related tools are available","training#Training":"","training-delivery-methods#Training delivery methods":"There are a number of training methods that can be used to train end users. Blended training, participatory and interactive techniques can be used to make the training effective. The table below has a list of some of the delivery methods.\nMethod Description Role play Learners act out the different roles they are assigned. Following the skit, there are discussions and conclusions related to the topic. Presentations A facilitator delivers content through oral, video and visual aids. Demonstrations A skill is demonstrated with a goal of facilitating understanding, eliciting comments and explanations. Pair work Participants are able to work in pairs so that participants with low confidence are able to learn from other participants. Case studies A facilitator presents facts about a theoretical case or scenario and learners are asked to intervene and make suggestions, followed by a conclusion about the case. Interactive simulations This method provides an opportunity for learners to practise a certain task for example how to register a new households on CHT. Teachbacks Trainees pick a topic or a skill they have learned in one of the sessions and teach it to their peers. Question and answer The learners are provided with a set of questions which they are expected to answer so as to establish their prior level of understanding of a certain topic. Hands-on practice Learners get to experience and practise what they have learned, for example a learner will get the experience of navigating a digital app. Individual work and assessments Participants work individually to answer written or oral questions about a topic that has already been covered in the training. Flip charts These are wall and board hangings that can serve as visual aids to reinforce learning. Group assessments Learners work together to answer questions or complete assigned tasks aimed at assessing knowledge of topics already covered in the training.","training-materials#Training materials":"Prepare training materials Prepare training agenda with daily training schedule. This should contain the trainer responsibilities and activities - here is an example of a training schedule Prepare screenshots or posters of training materials as backup Finalize user guides - here is an example of a user guide Finalize on the trainer and co-trainer resources Translate training materials and arrange for a translator, if required Organize supplies and stationery (markers, pens, notebooks, meta cards, tape, newsprint, index cards, handouts, take-home guides, projector and other required training equipment) Print training materials such as the ones listed below: Posters as a backup in case there is no electricity User guides Evaluations which include pre-tests and post-tests - here is an example of a pre/post test"},"title":"Training CHT Users"},"/building/training/users-bulk-load/":{"data":{"":"The bulk user upload feature is available in 3.16.0 and later versions of the CHT. As of CHT 3.17.0, when creating both a contact and a place, the contact will be set as the default contact of the place. User creation can be scripted using the CHT API directly or using the cht-conf tool, which is detailed in the CSV-to-Docs guide. This feature can be used to load as many users as possible but works optimally with chunks of 1,000 users or less. Steps to bulk load users:\nUsing Google Sheets, populate a spreadsheet with the users to be imported. Import the new users using the Admin UI in the CHT. Handle any errors that may occur during importation. When done, you will have created new users, new contacts and new places, all of which are correctly associated in CouchDB with the correct UUIDs. Workbook Instructions The workbook contains a varying number of spreadsheets depending on the hierarchy in question. Users with different roles are placed in different spreadsheets as shown in the templates below. For example when creating users with chw and chw_supervisor roles, you will have “contact.chw”, “contact.chw_VLOOKUP”, “contact.chw_supervisor” and “contact.chw_supervisor_VLOOKUP” spreadsheets. These pair per role spreadsheets contain actual data on users and parent place data respectively.\nThere is another spreadsheet, “place.type_VLOOKUP”, which is required when creating user accounts, contacts and their places. This spreadsheet defines the name and type of places in your hierarchy and should match those in the app_settings.json file. Note that you will need to create the parent place before importing the users.\nTo get started, there are three different workbook templates available that are compatible with the default configuration of the CHT, they cater for use cases that you might encounter when creating users in bulk. You will notice some columns have an :excluded suffix. These are columns that are ignored by the API and allow addition of autocomplete and data validation within the spreadsheet to make it easier to work with.\nClick on any of the use cases below to make a copy of the spreadsheet for the use case in question:\nwhen you want to create user accounts only when you want to create user accounts and their contacts when you want to create user accounts, their contacts and their places We will use the second use case to create user accounts and their contacts in the example below.\nContact Spreadsheet Instructions The spreadsheet interfaces with the POST /api/v1/users API which works as though passing a JSON array of users. Rows in the spreadsheet represent a user while columns represent properties of the user. Each column in the spreadsheet maps to an object property understood by the API to insert the users into the database. These properties can be found in the Users API documentation.\nContact spreadsheets are named according to the user role, for example when creating users who are chws and others who are chw_supervisors, the following contact spreadsheets are populated respectively: “contact.chw” and “contact.chw_supervisor”.\nThere are three sections to the contact spreadsheet:\nBulk user import spreadsheet with areas labeled","access-denied#Access denied":"If a user you successfully created can not log in because they see an error:\nAccess denied - You have insufficient privileges to view this page. Talk to an administrator to increase your privileges\nA possible cause of this is you have a bad role defined in your spreadsheet that doesn’t match your configuration. For example, the the default role should be chw_supervisor, but here we see garbage characters were accidentally added. While the user was created without errors, they’ll see the above error when they try to log in:\nBad type declared in spreadsheet causes the user to have no role\nYou may manually fix any users you imported to have the correct role. To ensure future users have valid roles to log in with, check the /admin/#/authorization/roles area on your CHT instance for valid roles:\nCHT admin showing a list of valid roles in the Role column on the left","adding-new-places#Adding new places":"Over time, new places will be added to different levels of the hierarchy. You will need to manually add these new places to the spreadsheet so that you can add users to the new places.\nNavigate in the CHT to the new site. In this case, it is “Site Dieco” that has been added (item 1). Copy the 36 character UUID from the URL (item 2). navigate in the CHT to the new site\nOpen your existing Google Spreadsheet with your users. Find the hierarchy level you added your new site. In this case “Site Dieco” is a CHW place, so we’ll go to the “contact.c62_chw_VLOOKUP” spreadsheet. Add some new rows at the bottom (item 1), enter the new place name in column A (item 2) and paste the UUID in column B (item 3) open your existing spreadsheet","configuring-custom-places-types#Configuring custom places types":"The third use case mentioned in the workbook instructions section links to a Google Sheets to create user places alongside their account and their contact. This works out of the box with the default CHT configuration but will require adjustments to be made in the place.type_VLOOKUP spreadsheet when dealing with a CHT configuration with custom places types.\nThe place.type_VLOOKUP spreadsheet has two columns that contain the name of the places types set in the .contact_types[] property of your app_settings.json and their respective IDs. The place type name is used by the User-Place-Type:excluded column in the contact.chw spreadsheet to provide a user-friendly way to pick a place with autocompletion. You will want to keep this spreadsheet in sync with your CHT configuration to create users’ places.","contact-spreadsheet-instructions#Contact Spreadsheet Instructions":"","importing-users-example#Importing users example":"Create a copy of this spreadsheet.

You will always come back to your copy of this Sheet whenever you want to add a set of users.\nCopy the “contact.chw” and “contact.chw_VLOOKUP” spreadsheets so that you have a set of the pair per level of your hierarchy. If your hierarchy was “Central -\u003e Supervisor -\u003e CHW”, you would have 3 pairs (6 spreadsheets total). Be sure each spreadsheet is named accurately.\nOpen the spreadsheet and populate your list of parent places that you’d like to use for your users.

Set Hierarchy":"You can configure hierarchies by editing the object corresponding to the \"contact_types\" key in app_settings.json. The following code sample represents the default hierarchy configuration. You can modify existing contact types by editing the objects within the array.\nWhen configuring a new deployment, it’s important to plan your hierarchy well. While there are no limits in the CHT to the hierarchical depth or breadth it will support, there are some trade-offs and caveats:\nWhile it is possible to update the hierarchy configuration after launch it can be difficult and potentially disruptive to users. Try and avoid this by planning ahead as best as possible. If your hierarchy is too shallow, users will download more docs than are necessary for their work which will impact the performance of the app. Taking the time to get the hierarchy configuration right makes it easy to give users access to only the docs they need. Important Note on Creating and Editing Contacts: The ability to create and edit contacts in the CHT, including person entities, is dependent on the presence of corresponding forms in the forms/contact directory. Each contact type, such as “person”, “clinic”, “health_center”, etc., must have associated create and edit forms defined. Without these forms, the functionality to add or modify these contact types in the CHT application will not be available. Ensure that the necessary forms are created and correctly referenced in the app_settings.json file under their respective contact type definitions. For guidance on creating these contact forms, refer to the CHT documentation on contact forms. For an example of where all the forms are represented in the default configuration, see the default config directory.\nSee Also: Hierarchy\n\"contact_types\": [ { \"id\": \"district_hospital\", \"name_key\": \"contact.type.district_hospital\", \"group_key\": \"contact.type.district_hospital.plural\", \"create_key\": \"contact.type.district_hospital.new\", \"edit_key\": \"contact.type.place.edit\", \"icon\": \"medic-district-hospital\", \"create_form\": \"form:contact:district_hospital:create\", \"edit_form\": \"form:contact:district_hospital:edit\" }, { \"id\": \"health_center\", \"name_key\": \"contact.type.health_center\", \"group_key\": \"contact.type.health_center.plural\", \"create_key\": \"contact.type.health_center.new\", \"edit_key\": \"contact.type.place.edit\", \"parents\": [ \"district_hospital\" ], \"icon\": \"medic-health-center\", \"create_form\": \"form:contact:health_center:create\", \"edit_form\": \"form:contact:health_center:edit\" }, { \"id\": \"clinic\", \"name_key\": \"contact.type.clinic\", \"group_key\": \"contact.type.clinic.plural\", \"create_key\": \"contact.type.clinic.new\", \"edit_key\": \"contact.type.place.edit\", \"parents\": [ \"health_center\" ], \"icon\": \"medic-clinic\", \"create_form\": \"form:contact:clinic:create\", \"edit_form\": \"form:contact:clinic:edit\", \"count_visits\": true }, { \"id\": \"person\", \"name_key\": \"contact.type.person\", \"group_key\": \"contact.type.person.plural\", \"create_key\": \"contact.type.person.new\", \"edit_key\": \"contact.type.person.edit\", \"primary_contact_key\": \"clinic.field.contact\", \"parents\": [ \"district_hospital\", \"health_center\", \"clinic\" ], \"icon\": \"medic-person\", \"create_form\": \"form:contact:person:create\", \"edit_form\": \"form:contact:person:edit\", \"person\": true } ]","4-set-replication-depth#4.

Depending on the number and complexity of app components, it can take a lot of time and effort to test the components manually. Some components, such as tasks, behave differently over time and are particularly challenging to test. As the project evolves, the configuration is often updated with new components and changes are made to the existing components. After each change, you need to test not only the new components, but also the old ones to make sure that the app works as expected. To facilitate the testing process, app builders are encouraged to write automated tests for their app using cht-conf-test-harness.\nBecause it may be complicated to test with a real application, cht-conf-test-harness (also simply referred as harness), provides a platform that simulates the CHT application instance.\nUsing cht-conf-test-harness, you can write tests and run them with Mocha testing framework to test the behavior of different components in a CHT application. Mocha works with a variety of assertion libraries including chai, should.js, expect.js, better-assert, unexpected among others.","importance-of-testing-your-application#Importance of testing your application":"Testing your CHT application is important as it ensures you are consistently maintaining your application and defining implementation requirements. Testing also helps the user make better architectural decisions, optimizes the forms, tasks and other components of the application. Although it may seem tedious, testing your application ensures that you quickly discover issues that are introduced with changes or newer commits.","preparation#Preparation":"Writing tests for CHT apps requires a good understanding of the project workflows and requirements. To test using the harness, there are a few things you need to set up:\nFrom the previous tutorials, you should have a functioning CHT instance with cht-conf installed locally and a project folder set up. cht-conf which is short for CHT app configurer, is a command-line interface tool used to manage and configure your CHT apps. It is used for backup, conversion, validation, uploading and other actions which can be found by running cht --help.\nEnsure your package.json file has the required libraries. A package.json file is used to record important metadata about a project and defines functional attributes that npm uses to install dependencies and run scripts. This file should be at the root of your project folder. If your package.json file does not already have them, add cht-conf-test-harness, chai, and mocha by running this in your command-line:\nnpm install --save-dev cht-conf-test-harness chai mocha Also, add the following scripts to package.json, if not already present:\n\"scripts\": { \"test\": \"npm run compile-forms \u0026\u0026 npm run compile-app-settings \u0026\u0026 npm run unittest\", \"compile-app-settings\": \"npx cht --no-check compile-app-settings\", \"compile-forms\": \"npx cht --no-check convert-app-forms convert-contact-forms\", \"unittest\": \"mocha test/**/*.spec.js --timeout 20000\" } After adding these scripts, you are able to run the tests by running one of these commands from the command-line:\nCommand Description npm run test Compiles the app settings, converts the forms,then runs the tests (preferred solution). npm run unittest Only runs the unit tests. You can also run the test on a specific form by defining a test under the scripts section.\nFor example, to run the test on the death.spec.js file, define the test as death-form-unit-test: \"mocha test/forms/death.spec.js --timeout 20000\". Then run:\nnpm run death-form-unit-test npm also supports a shorter alias as npm test. There are recommended conventions on how to arrange tests by splitting into unit tests and integration tests so that each of them can be run independently. This can be best illustrated by this project code.\nCreate a folder in the project root where you keep the tests. You can name the folder yourself. In this case it is named ’test’. Create a file harness.defaults.json at the root of your project. This is the default configuration file for the harness. Here you can specify the default user, preloaded contacts and reports, and add other settings. Here’s an example file to get you started. You can read more about it here.","prerequisites#Prerequisites":"Complete the following tutorials:\nBuilding App Forms Building A Simple Task Building Target Widgets Building Contact Summary","testing-contact-summary#Testing Contact Summary":"What do you test? Minimum: Fill a contact form and count the number of fields in the contact summary Ideal: Targeted tests for calculations of context, fields, cards, etc. Contact summary consists of visible components such as cards, fields and a hidden component: context. All these can be tested with the test harness.\nUse harness.getContactSummary() method to get the ContactSummary object, which has these properties: fields, cards, and context.\nTo test the contact summary fields added in the previous tutorial, use the following test case:\nconst contactSummary = await harness.getContactSummary(); expect(contactSummary.fields).to.have.property('length', 5); expect(contactSummary.fields.filter(f =\u003e f.filter !== 'lineage')).to.deep.equal( [ { label: 'patient_id', value: 'patient_id', width: 4 }, { label: 'contact.age', value: '1970-07-09', width: 4, filter: 'age' }, { label: 'contact.sex', value: 'contact.sex.female', translate: true, width: 4 }, { label: 'person.field.phone', value: undefined, width: 4} ] ); Here, the contact summary being tested represents the contact that is being “acted on” or the “subject of the test”. To learn more about this, look at the subject property here.\nSimilarly, you can test the condition cards too. Here is an example for testing the assessment condition card added in this tutorial:\n// Load the assessment form and fill in 'yes' on the first page and '7' on the second page const result = await harness.fillForm('assessment', ['yes'], ['7']); // Verify that the form successfully got submitted expect(result.errors).to.be.empty; const contactSummary = await harness.getContactSummary(); // Verify that there is one card expect(contactSummary.cards).to.have.property('length', 1); // Verify the fields on the card expect(contactSummary.cards[0].fields).to.deep.equal( [ { label: 'contact.profile.most_recent_assessment.date', value: result.report.reported_date, width: 6, filter: 'simpleDate' }, { label: 'contact.profile.cough', value: 'yes', width: 6 }, ] ); If you follow this code sample to create the pregnancy condition card, the pregnancy context can be tested this way:\nconst summaryContext = harness.getContactSummary().context; expect(summaryContext).to.include({ pregnant: true });","testing-forms#Testing Forms":"What do you test? Minimum: Filling a form with the most common options should not result in any error. Ideal: All input combinations and constraints are tested with the report fields. Previous example demonstrates test for the app form. More test cases can be added by changing the inputs.\nYou can also test contact forms using test harness. To fill a contact form, use fillContactForm(contactType, …answers).\nExample:\nconst result = await harness.fillContactForm( 'district_hospital', ['new_person', 'William Mars', '1990-08-06', '+1234567891', 'female'], ['yes'] ); expect(result.errors).to.be.empty; expect(result.contacts).excluding(['_id', 'meta']).to.deep.eq([ { ... } ]); When filling a form, you can also test the field constraints. The example below asserts that a form does not accept birth date in the future:\nit(`Throws validation error when birth date is in future`, async () =\u003e { const result = await harness.fillForm('delivery', ['yes', '2090-01-02']); expect(result.errors.length).to.equal(1); expect(result.errors[0]).to.include({ msg: 'Date cannot be in the future!' }); }); Note: If a form triggers a task, some use cases of the form can be tested when testing the task later.","testing-targets#Testing Targets":"Testing a target is relatively straightforward. Add a report or contact that increments a target, then check the target values.\nWhat do you test? Minimum: Trigger incrementing of the targetEnsure target doesn’t increment when it shouldn’t Ideal: One test for each user scenarioEnsure proper deduplication (particularly for those with emitCustom) Use harness.getTargets to check the state of targets. It returns a Target object which corresponds to the targets schema.\nTo test the first two targets created in the targets tutorial, use this code:\nit('assessment this month and all time assessments should show correct counts', async () =\u003e { //set the current date harness.setNow('2000-01-30'); //assessment form filled const result = await harness.fillForm('assessment', ['yes'], ['7']); expect(result.errors).to.be.empty; const thisMonth = await harness.getTargets({ type: 'assessments-this-month' }); expect(thisMonth).to.have.property('length', 1); //The number of assessments in this month should be 1 expect(thisMonth[0]).to.nested.include({ 'value.pass': 1, 'value.total': 1 }); let allTime = await harness.getTargets({ type: 'assessments-all-time' }); expect(thisMonth).to.have.property('length', 1); //The number of all time assessments should be 1 expect(thisMonth[0]).to.nested.include({ 'value.pass': 1, 'value.total': 1 }); //Go to next month by adding 2 days (Jan 30 to Feb 1) harness.flush(2); const nextMonth = await harness.getTargets({ type: 'assessments-this-month' }); expect(nextMonth).to.have.property('length', 1); //The number of assessments this month now should be reset to 0 expect(nextMonth[0]).to.nested.include({ 'value.pass': 0, 'value.total': 0 }); allTime = await harness.getTargets({ type: 'assessments-all-time' }); expect(allTime).to.have.property('length', 1); //The number of all time assessments should still be 1 expect(allTime[0]).to.nested.include({ 'value.pass': 1, 'value.total': 1 }); }); For targets with type: 'percent', you might want to check for more properties:\nexpect(targets[0]).to.nested.include({ 'value.pass': 1, 'value.total': 1, 'value.percent': 100 });","testing-tasks#Testing Tasks":"What do you test? Minimum: Trigger and resolve the task Ideal: One test for each use scenarioCode coverage for any arc with an external dependencyNegative cases - confirm tasks don’t trigger When testing the tasks manually, you need to fill a form. Then to see the task, you need to either change the system date to move forward in time or change the reported date of the document accordingly. These are very tedious and unreliable methods. Using the test harness, you can quickly test the tasks under different scenarios and at different simulated dates.\nEvery task has a source document (contact or report). When testing, you can mock the source document. Yet, the recommended approach is to fill the source form and then proceed with checking the associated tasks.\nCommonly used harness methods when testing tasks are:\nharness.setNow(): Set the current mock-time of the harness.\nharness.flush(): Increment the current time by an amount\nharness.getTasks(): Check which tasks are visible\nharness.loadAction(): Simulates the user clicking on an action\nWith getTasks(), you get an array of Task objects which corresponds to the tasks schema.\nLet’s look back at the simple task from this tutorial: Building A Simple Task.\nAccording to the task configuration, these conditions need to be met for the assessment task to be visible:\nThe contact_type of the subject (patient) is: patient The contact_type of the user’s parent is: chw_area The current time is between the start and end dates of the task event. When testing with harness, the conditions 1 and 2 above can be set in the harness.defaults.json file. See the lines 31 and 26 respectively in the sample file further below.\nFor the condition 3, let’s look at the task event window in the task definition. As mentioned in the earlier tutorial, the task event is:\nDue 7 days after the contact’s creation date. Should appear 7 days before the due date, or immediately when the contact is created. Should disappear the day after the due date. So, to see the task, the contact should be created within the last 7 days. You can easily set the contact’s reported date so that it falls within the last 7 days (see line 36 below).\nharness.defaults.json: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 { \"coreVersion\": \"3.14.0\", \"user\": \"chw_id\", \"subject\": \"patient_id\", \"ownedBySubject\": true, \"docs\": [ { \"_id\": \"chw_id\", \"name\": \"CHW\", \"date_of_birth\": \"1971-03-10\", \"phone\": \"+17782475555\", \"reported_date\": 1550559625153, \"type\": \"person\", \"parent\": { \"_id\": \"chw_area_id\", \"parent\": { \"_id\": \"district_id\" } } }, { \"_id\": \"chw_area_id\", \"type\": \"contact\", \"contact_type\": \"chw_area\" }, { \"_id\": \"patient_id\", \"type\": \"contact\", \"contact_type\": \"patient\", \"name\": \"Patient Name\", \"role\": \"patient\", \"date_of_birth\": \"1970-07-09\", \"sex\": \"female\", \"reported_date\": 1652868491000, \"patient_id\": \"patient_id\", \"parent\": { \"_id\": \"patient_parent_id\", \"parent\": { \"_id\": \"chw_area_id\", \"parent\": { \"_id\": \"district_id\" } } } } ] } Note that the reported_date above stores the epoch timestamp in milliseconds when the document was first created. You can use external website epochconverter to convert the timestamp to and from a human readable date.\nAfter setting the harness defaults, you can now test the task:\n// Get the task by title const tasks = await harness.getTasks({title: 'First Assessment'}); //Make sure that you have the task expect(tasks).to.have.property('length', 1); // Load the task action and fill it. const result = await harness.loadAction(tasks[0], ['yes'], ['7']); // Verify that the form successfully got submitted expect(result.errors).to.be.empty; // Verify that the task is no longer visible expect(await harness.getTasks()).to.be.empty; If a task is triggered by a report, then fill in the app form to create report before test:\nit('followup schedule', async () =\u003e { const result = await harness.fillForm(...pncFollowups.registerBirth('2000-01-01', '2000-02-01')); expect(result.errors).to.be.empty; /* Task should appear 7 days after birth for follow up */ await harness.flush(7); const tasks = await harness.getTasks(); expect(tasks).to.have.property('length', 1); /* Complete the task, task should disappear */ await harness.loadAction(tasks[0].emission.actions[0]); const followupResult = await harness.fillForm(...pncFollowups.followup.healthy); expect(followupResult.errors).to.be.empty; expect(await harness.getTasks()).to.be.empty; /* Confirm a task appears again on the schedule */ await harness.flush(21); expect(await harness.getTasks()).to.have.property('length', 1); }); You may pass other data from a task to the action form using modifyContent attribute of a task.

For debugging the unit tests in VS Code, here is a sample configuration file (launch.json):\n{ \"version\": \"0.2.0\", \"configurations\": [ { \"type\": \"node\", \"request\": \"launch\", \"name\": \"Run Mocha Tests\", \"program\": \"${workspaceFolder}/node_modules/mocha/bin/_mocha\", \"args\": [ \"--timeout\", \"999999\", \"--colors\", \"${workspaceFolder}/test/tasks/assessment.spec.js\", \"--grep\", \"should show\" \"--dev\", ], \"internalConsoleOptions\": \"openOnSessionStart\" } ] }","writing-a-test-for-cht-app#Writing a test for CHT App":"Start by adding a file where a group of related tests are written. For example, in the default config, all tests for the pregnancy form are in the pregnancy.spec.js file. The common naming pattern for CHT applications test files is filename.spec.js. In JavaScript testing, spec is short for specifications which refers to technical details of a given application, that must be fulfilled.\nLet’s introduce some important sections from a typical test file:\nconst TestRunner = require('cht-conf-test-harness'); const harness = new TestRunner(); In the example above, we define variables TestRunner and harness. TestRunner imports the Harness class and harness creates an instance of the class that is used throughout the test file.\nYou can also pass parameters to the TestRunner() when instantiating:\n// For detailed console logs const harness = new TestRunner({ verbose: true }); Other useful options are:\n{ headless: false } - Passed to puppeteer, launches browser with GUI. Helpful to see how the form is getting filled. { harnessDataPath: 'harness.clinic.json'}: Specify different harness configuration You can find more harness options and examples here.\nYou need to start the harness before running tests and stop it after the use. To handle start and stop of harness, place following statements in before() and after() hooks of the test suite.\ndescribe('PNC form tests', () =\u003e { before(async () =\u003e { return await harness.start(); }); after(async () =\u003e { return await harness.stop(); }); Any logic that you want to execute before and after each test can be placed in the beforeEach() and afterEach() hooks. This section ensures that the harness is reset to default before or after each run.\nIn the example below, the logic is to clear the state of the harness and set the date to ‘2000-01-01’ before each test run:\nbeforeEach( async () =\u003e { await harness.clear(); await harness.setNow('2000-01-01'); }); After each test run, assert that there are no errors in the console.\nafterEach(() =\u003e { expect(harness.consoleErrors).to.be.empty; }); If you want to learn more about these hooks, refer to this Mocha resource. Feel free to customize the hooks as you see fit.\nLet’s look at a more detailed example. Here is a test case for the Assessment form that was covered in the previous tutorial:\nit('unit test confirming assessment with cough since 7 days', async () =\u003e { // Load the assessment form and fill 'yes' on the first page and '7' on the second page const result = await harness.fillForm('assessment', ['yes'], ['7']); // Verify that the form successfully got submitted expect(result.errors).to.be.empty; // Verify some attributes on the resulting report expect(result.report.fields).to.deep.include({ patient_name: 'Patient Name', group_assessment: { cough: 'yes', cough_duration: '7', } }); }); In line 4 above, the method harness.fillForm() fills the specified form with the given input (answers).\nDepending on the form design, the number of inputs to be filled can be large. The inputs are often repeated within a single test or across multiple tests with little or no variation. It is a good idea to keep them in a separate file and refer them from the tests as required. You can also introduce some variations in the inputs using function parameters.\nExample: form-inputs.js\nmodule.exports = { assessments: { no_cough: [ ['no'] ], cough: (days) =\u003e [ ['yes'], [ days ] ] } }; In the test below, the inputs are used from the form-inputs.js file above:\nconst { assessments } = require('../form-inputs'); ... const result = await harness.fillForm('assessment', ...assessments.cough('3')); The test files are usually grouped in folders to read and run them easily. One way of grouping them is by creating folders for each of the components that can be tested: forms, contact summary, tasks, and targets.\nTest directory structure"},"title":"Application Tests"},"/building/tutorials/multi-facility-users/":{"data":{"":"This tutorial will take you through how to create and assign users to multiple places in the CHT UI.

When a Contact is muted, they will appear differently on the People tab and CHWs will no longer receive tasks or SMS about them.\nTo start receiving notifications about a Contact again, CHWs can unmute them. When a Contact is unmuted, tasks and SMS schedules will resume, but notifications that would have been sent while they were muted will not.","configurability#Configurability":"While it’s most common to have dedicated mute and unmute forms, any form can be set up to mute or unmute a Contact. It’s also possible to set up verification flows for muting whereby mute/unmute requires a Supervisor to verify before the mute/unmute happens. And like the rest of the CHT, all text is customizable.","mute-a-contact#Mute a Contact":"To mute a Contact, CHWs typically submit a “Mute” form about them. This can be done either from the People tab or the Reports tab. When a person is muted, in addition to their notifications being silenced, their icon turns grey and a “Muted” status is displayed beneath their name. While a person or place is muted, CHWs and Nurses can still submit other forms about them.\nSome changes are observed in the UI when a family or a person is muted to make the muted status clear and easily recognizable. The person’s or family’s icon turns grey and a status of “Muted” displays on the second line below the person’s or family’s name. Any actions that were previously available on the family or person remain available on the profile.\nWhen a place is muted, all places and people beneath it will automatically be muted as well. For example, if a family is muted, all individuals in that family will automatically be muted. It is not possible to have a muted family with some family members that are not muted. This means that if a new person is added to a muted family, that person will automatically be muted when they are created.","muting-vs-death-reporting#Muting vs Death Reporting":"A project may support both death reporting and muting - they are not mutually exclusive.

Tasks indicate a recommended action to the user. They indicate who the user should perform the action with, and the recommended timeframe of that action. When the user taps the task, they are directed to a form where the details of the action are captured.\nTasks can be triggered by a set of conditions, such as contact details or submitted reports. Tasks are accessible in the Tasks tab and the profile in the Contact tab, and initiate a follow up action to complete a form. More information on building app workflows is available in the Tasks section.\nData submitted in one form can generate several tasks at once, for example, multiple ANC visits following one pregnancy registration. Some workflows involve a series of sequential forms and tasks, such as a child health assessment form, a follow up task scheduled 48 hours later, a referral form (only if the child’s condition hasn’t improved), and then a referral follow up task.

Depending on the severity of a violation, lower rungs on the ladder may be skipped.\nWarning Event: A violation involving a single incident or series of incidents. Consequence: A private, written warning from the Community Moderators. Repair: Examples of repair include a private written apology, acknowledgement of responsibility, and seeking clarification on expectations. Temporarily Limited Activities Event: A repeated incidence of a violation that previously resulted in a warning, or the first incidence of a more serious violation. Consequence: A private, written warning with a time-limited cooldown period designed to underscore the seriousness of the situation and give the community members involved time to process the incident. The cooldown period may be limited to particular communication channels or interactions with particular community members. Repair: Examples of repair may include making an apology, using the cooldown period to reflect on actions and impact, and being thoughtful about re-entering community spaces after the period is over. Temporary Suspension Event: A pattern of repeated violation which the Community Moderators have tried to address with warnings, or a single serious violation. Consequence: A private written warning with conditions for return from suspension. In general, temporary suspensions give the person being suspended time to reflect upon their behavior and possible corrective actions. Repair: Examples of repair include respecting the spirit of the suspension, meeting the specified conditions for return, and being thoughtful about how to reintegrate with the community when the suspension is lifted. Permanent Ban Event: A pattern of repeated code of conduct violations that other steps on the ladder have failed to resolve, or a violation so serious that the Community Moderators determine there is no way to keep the community safe with this person as a member. Consequence: Access to all community spaces, tools, and communication channels is removed. In general, permanent bans should be rarely used, should have strong reasoning behind them, and should only be resorted to if working through other remedies has failed to change the behavior. Repair: There is no possible repair in cases of this severity. This enforcement ladder is intended as a guideline. It does not limit the ability of Community Managers to use their discretion and judgment, in keeping with the best interests of our community.","attribution#Attribution":"This Code of Conduct is adapted from the Contributor Covenant, version 3.0, permanently available at https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/3/0/.\nContributor Covenant is stewarded by the Organization for Ethical Source and licensed under CC BY-SA 4.0.

Some older versions of Android will not have a new enough Android System Webview to be able to run the CHT webapp. This is particularly true of emulated Android devices, which typically are configured to not receive updates. To test the CHT functionality on these devices you must manually upgrade the version of the Chrome/Webview apk used as the Android System Webview.\nTo upgrade the necessary apk on an emulated Android device:\nStart by using the Google APIs variant of the Android image. The base AOSP image bakes in the com.android.webview package, making it difficult to update. Depending on your version of Android, you will need to manually download a new version of the apk (make sure to get the correct variant for your architecture): For Android 7-9, you should download a new version of com.android.chrome (e.g. from apkMirror). For Android 10+, you should download a new version of com.google.android.webview (e.g. from apkMirror). Then, you can use adb to install the apk into the device: adb install -r *your_apk*.apk Note\nTesting using an Android 5-6 device can be more challenging. The com.android.webview package seems to be baked into the system partition regardless of the image variant. It is possible use a custom ROM (e.g. CyanogenMod) with an upgraded WebView version on a physical device. Another approach to testing with older versions of Android is to simply test against an older version of the CHT (e.g. CHT 3.x. only requires Chrome/Webview 53). The functionality of cht-android can still be validated by interacting with this old CHT version.\nIf using the docker-helper to deploy CHT instances for testing with old Android versions, be aware that the local-ip.medicmobile.org SSL certificates may not work with the device (because the root certificate is not recognized). On Android 5-6 you can manually install the root certificate via Settings \u003e Security \u003e Install from SD Card.","requirements#Requirements":"Java 17+ (OpenJDK versions work). Android SDK, and optionally Android Studio. The adb command for debugging and get the logs. The source code.

Software development is not just about writing code, but rather about solving problems and building the right solutions. Before diving into an initiative or feature and starting coding, it’s essential that the developers (and other team members) have a high-level understanding of what a solution might look like.\nDesign docs are informal documents that the leading developer of a certain piece of software creates before they start the actual coding of a solution. The design doc contains high-level technical design decisions and alternatives that were considered when making those decisions.\nWhy write design docs? Besides being an excellent way of documenting software design, design docs come with several additional benefits:\nInvolve the team early and get feedback before implementation, after which changes are more difficult. Identify solution concerns and issues rapidly, as making changes to a solution in the design phase is faster. Provide a fantastic way to document technical decisions, which benefits the team, the community, and future contributors. Ensure the consideration of alternative solutions, assumptions and eventual constraints. Achieve consensus in the team around the design and get everyone on the same page. What could a design doc contain? The design doc can be added to the GitHub issue related to the feature or initiative to be implemented or in a Google Doc.\nThe list below contains a non-exhaustive list of items a design doc could cover.","alternative-solutions-considered#Alternative solutions considered":"A list of alternative designs that would have achieved similar outcomes, together with the trade-offs that each respective design makes and how those trade-offs led to the decision to select the proposed solution.","assumptions#Assumptions":"A description of the assumptions made, for example user interface design or general system characteristics (e.g. operating systems).","constraints#Constraints":"These can include constraints such as security, scalability, or performance.","context#Context":"An overview of the context in which the piece of software is being built and what is actually being built.

What are the tradeoffs being made as a result of these decisions? Is there any information you are aware of which the writer may not have known? Have you seen a similar solution (successful or not) used before? What external systems does this initiative interact with? Does it follow current good practices and patterns?

When deciding to whether write a design doc or not, it’s essential to reflect on the core trade-off of whether the benefits in the alignment around technical design, documentation, senior review, outweigh the extra work of actually creating the doc. If a doc basically says “This is how I am going to implement this feature” without going into trade-offs, alternatives, and explaining decision making (or if the solution is so obvious that there were no trade-offs), then it would probably have been a better idea to write the actual code right away instead of going through the effort of putting together a design doc.\nOften, the overhead of creating and reviewing a design doc may not be compatible with prototyping and fast iteration. If “you tried it out and it worked”, it might mean that you already have a solution that’s worth pursuing without having to write a document. However, it’s important to remember that subscribing to agile methodologies and fast iteration is not an excuse for not taking the time to get solutions to known problems right.","why-write-design-docs#Why write design docs?":""},"title":"Design Docs"},"/community/contributing/code/quality-assistance/":{"data":{"":"","an-example-of-qa-assistance-in-practice#An Example of QA Assistance in Practice":"Imagine a scenario where a community member or a squad is going to change the display of the targets screen. The group would discuss the needs of the users and work out solutions, where the selected solution was to make this change. This discussion could involve project managers, designers, developers, and QA engineers. The developer would be thinking about how to code the proposed solution and the QA engineer would be considering that as well as what might go wrong.\nIn the case where a UI change is being made, a design will be created. At this point the group can see what is to be built. When meeting and discussing the user interactions with the designer the QA engineer can get some early ideas around test scenarios.\nAs code is written and pushed to a branch the QA engineer and developer talk about what is changing. Any misconceptions are cleared up and the QA engineer can start to assist the developer by pointing out areas that may be important or non-obvious to test. This could be as simple as noting challenges of different screen sizes or as complex as specific configurations that may need extra attention for how targets work.\nThat conversation (ideally multiple of these) is the “assistance”. It’s where the value of the QA engineering mindset is achieved. The developer still owns and tests their work; they just have a QA engineer to talk to so they can feel confident in their own testing.\nDepending on the change the developer may work with the QA engineer where the QA engineer can contribute some automated end-to-end testing to the branch. Things should feel collaborative and not a division of labor or handing things off.\nOnce the developer has finished writing the code they test it a bit more and open a PR for a code review. The reviewer should be able to review the code with an assumption that it is well-tested already and the focus of the review can be around the code and implementation choices.\nIf any changes need to be made during the review process, the developer makes those changes and re-executes any relevant testing.\nAt this point the ideal action to take would be that the developer merges the finished code and no AT step happens, as the quality is already baked in from the start and throughout. This is the ideal setup yet to be achieved. Here the ticket still goes to AT, but for a smaller last bit of smoke testing. Notice that it is not an exhaustive set of tests, it is a small bit of extra poking around by a QA engineer. This limited testing is possible because the developer said it is done, and they said that because they tested it, and they had a QA engineer assist them to reach that level of confidence in their own testing.\nThe last part here is to merge it. That extra poking around should be quick, so the developer should be ready to click the green button soon!","faq#FAQ":"Who checks if the right thing got built? The community/squad members should be aware of what’s being built, why, and if it’s coming together as expected. That’s not to be solely delegated to a QA engineer to do. Developers should be working with the community and showing their work (demos, screenshots, etc). This should feel like a team collaborating to build useful working software, not an assembly line of disassociated parts. What if a developer is bad at testing? That’s something to improve, not outsource to someone else. Even still, the QA engineer isn’t disappearing and they will still offer deeper advice on what tests the developer should perform. What will QA engineers do if not doing manual acceptance testing? Automating more. That can be in more end-to-end tests for better regression testing, automating mobile device testing, adding better structures to enable the whole team to automate better, improving CI pipeline, etc.","getting-there-in-milestones#Getting There in Milestones":"The aim is to get to a place where the developer of a change can do everything and merge without needing any extra permission. To make the process safer in getting to the final step, several parts will be followed. A process similar to what’s described In Detail is followed, while retaining an “AT” step similar to what the current process.\nThe big difference to that AT step though will be the depth in which it is performed. Rather than being a single exhaustive step where all testing is performed, it will be more like a smoke test where a QA engineer gets a little extra creative in testing.\nThere may still be cases of a ticket getting coded up totally unrelated to bigger initiative work, perhaps even unannounced to anyone. For work like this the traditional AT step is still appropriate for now. Still though, it is preferred for the software developer to get a QA engineer involved as early as possible; it helps us get the best contributions from everyone.","goals#Goals":"Software developers should have full ownership of what they are building, including quality. The team still benefits from having the QA engineering mindset of QA engineers. QA engineers automate more tests and processes.","in-detail#In Detail":"A developer should be able to write code and release it when done. Doing that without testing would be reckless and it is expected that the developer also tests their code. The team wants both speed and quality where the former should not be done without the latter. This means slowing down a bit to make sure it’s right and checking your work when developing before it is done/reviewed/merged.\nIt isn’t always easy to test your own code though and it is common for a developer to have a happy-path mindset, more suited for thinking about what to build rather than how something might break. Fortunately there are QA engineers on the team who have the skills to think about the solution from the perspective of what might break.\nIt’s worth noting that the team also requires code reviews via GitHub pull requests. The intention of code reviews is not for the reviewer to test the code. The reviewer may optionally also do that, but it is expected that the author of the code has tested it fully before requesting a code review.\nOnce code is done, tested (by the developer) and reviewed, it is ready to merge and the developer can do so… almost (see Getting There in Milestones).","in-short#In Short":"A software developer writes code and performs testing on that code where a QA engineer assists by recommending tests to perform and adding additional end-to-end tests."},"title":"Quality Assistance"},"/community/contributing/code/releasing/":{"data":{"":"","android-apps#Android apps":"Follow the instructions in the Android \u003e Releasing section.","building--releasing-cht-core-changes#Building \u0026amp; Releasing CHT Core Changes":"The high-level steps for a release are as follows:\nThe CHT Community sees an opportunity they want to go after.

This should be fixed before the release. There is a high priority bug found in an existing release that it is estimated to be fixed in less than 5 days. The way to determine if a bug is high priority is if a service pack release is needed to fix it later. If so then it makes sense to wait for the fix to save the effort of having to do two releases in quick succession. If it’s going to take longer than 5 days then it’s worth the additional effort of releasing a service pack. After 5 days if the fix isn’t merged, then continue with the release regardless. The reason to have these rules while waiting, is so that all contributors know what they are and the release manager never needs to ask “should we wait?” - they’ll know already!\nWhile waiting the release manager should use the time effectively by doing as many release steps as possible including writing release notes, preparing the release branch, etc so that the release can be finalized as quickly as possible once the fixes are made."},"title":"Releasing"},"/community/contributing/code/releasing/feature_releases/":{"data":{"":"To build and iterate on new features at a pace that is faster than our regular release cycle, some features are released in a Feature Release.

This documentation will cover the CSV notation used, fetching CSV files from Google Sheets, converting the CSV files into JSON docs, and then uploading the data from the JSON files to your instance.\nConverting CSVs Running cht-conf with the csv-to-docs action converts CSV files from the csv folder into JSON docs to be uploaded to your instance. The JSON files are stored in the json_docs folder. Instructions for creating the CSV files are in sections below.\nUploading CSVs Running cht-conf with the upload-docs action will upload the JSON docs that were generated from the CSV files to your instance. For example, running cht --local upload-docs will upload the converted docs into your local instance. The target location --local can be replaced with an instance or URL. See cht-conf for detailed instructions.\nCreating CSV files for Contacts, Reports A separate CSV file is needed for each type of place, person, or report in your project’s local csv folder. The name of the file determines the type of doc created for rows contained in the file. The possible types are: report, person, and place. Each of these has a further specifier provided in the filename:\nplace.{place_type}.csv: where {place_type} is the type of place specified in the file. By default, the place types are one of clinic, health_center, or district_hospital. As of 3.7 of the Core Framework, the number of place types and their names can be configured — the {place_type} should match with the hierarchy names used. person.{parent_place_type}.csv: where {parent_place_type} is the type of place to which the people in the file will belong. report.{form_id}.csv: where {form_id} is the form ID for all the reports in the file. You will need one file per form ID Here are some examples:\nFile named place.district_hospital.csv adds the property \"type\":\"district_hospital\" File named person.clinic.csv add the property \"type\":\"person\" File named report.immunization_visit.csv add the property \"type\":\"report\", \"form\":\"immunization_visit\" In each of these files a header row is used to specify the JSON field names, and each subsequent row specifies the corresponding values for a doc. A _id field is automatically generated with a universally unique identifier.\nHere is an example of a csv/person.clinic.csv file for people belonging to clinics:\nname,sex,date_of_birth Adriana Akiyama,female,1985-12-31 Becky Backlund,female,1987-10-17 Carson Crane,male,2015-01-23 Here is the table representation of the CSV:\nname sex date_of_birth Adriana Akiyama female 1985-12-31 Becky Backlund female 1987-10-17 Carson Crane male 2015-01-23 Converting that CSV file to JSON docs with the csv-to-docs action would generate three files, one for each person. Here is one of the corresponding JSON files, json_docs/dbfbc0f0-117a-59ec-9542-3313fb10ef25.doc.json, which was created from the CSV data above:\n{ \"type\": \"person\", \"name\": \"Adriana Akiyama\", \"sex\": \"female\", \"date_of_birth\": \"1985-12-31\", \"_id\": \"dbfbc0f0-117a-59ec-9542-3313fb10ef25\" } Special notations Specifying property type By default, values are parsed as strings. To parse a CSV column as a different JSON type, append the JSON type name to the column definition, e.g.\ncolumn_one,column_two:bool,column_three:int,column_four:float,column_five:date,column_six:timestamp some string,true,1,2.3,2017-12-31,1513255007072 This would create a structure such as:\n{ \"_id\": \"09efb53f-9cd8-524c-9dfd-f62c242f1817\", \"column_one\": \"some string\", \"column_two\": true, \"column_three\": 1, \"column_four\": 2.3, \"column_five\": \"2017-12-31T00:00:00.000Z\", \"column_six\": 1513255007072 } Excluding column A special column type, excluded, is used for excluding a column from the final JSON data:\nmy_column_that_will_not_be_a_property:excluded This can be useful if using a column for doc references.\nAvailable types type outcome date Creates a date using Date() in javascript rel-date Creates a date with the addition of number days to the current date. A negative number results in a past date. timestamp Sets the string passed in as a timestamp number. If the timestamp in the csv is in milliseconds that will be used. If a date is passed it will be parsed and the milliseconds returned. EX: 04 Dec 1995 00:12:00 GMT becomes 818035920000 rel-timestamp Creates a timestamp that is offset by milliseconds against the current(NOW) timestamp. A negative number results in a past timestamp int Parses the value as an int using Number.parseInt() bool Sets boolean value based on string passed, either \"true\" or \"false\" string Sets the value as the string being interpreted. Can be omitted if values are only strings. float Sets value using Number.parseFloat() Including another doc Often times database documents need to include or refer to other documents in the database. This can be achieved with queries across CSV files, which is done by specifying a query in the column header. The query specifies the doc type (person or place) and matching condition.\nFor instance, to include the parent district’s doc in a health center’s doc, the parent:place WHERE reference_id=COL_VAL column header is used. The COL_VAL is a special notation for that column’s value for the row, and it will be used to match against the reference_id field in all other places. Given these example CSVs, you can see the corresponding JSON structure:\nplace.district.csv:\nreference_id:excluded is_name_generated name reported_date:timestamp district_1 false D1 1544031155715 district_2 false D2 1544031155715 district_3 false D3 1544031155715 place.health_center.csv:\nreference_id:excluded parent:place WHERE reference_id=COL_VAL is_name_generated name reported_date:timestamp health_center_1 district_1 false HC1 1544031155715 health_center_2 district_2 false HC2 1544031155715 health_center_3 district_3 false HC3 1544031155715 480d0cd0-c021-5d55-8c63-d86576d592fc.doc.json:\n{ \"type\": \"health_center\", \"parent\": { \"type\": \"district_hospital\", \"parent\": \"\", \"is_name_generated\": \"false\", \"name\": \"D2\", \"external_id\": \"\", \"notes\": \"\", \"geolocation\": \"\", \"reported_date\": 1544031155715, \"_id\": \"f223f240-5d6a-5a7a-91d4-46d3c59de73e\" }, \"is_name_generated\": \"false\", \"name\": \"HC7\", \"external_id\": \"\", \"notes\": \"\", \"geolocation\": \"\", \"reported_date\": 1544031155715, \"_id\": \"480d0cd0-c021-5d55-8c63-d86576d592fc\" }","available-types#Available types":"","converting-csvs#Converting CSVs":"","creating-csv-files-for-contacts-reports#Creating CSV files for Contacts, Reports":"","creating-csv-files-for-users#Creating CSV files for users":"To create user accounts from CSV files, a users.csv file will be needed in the csv folder.

The document creation rate for this process (including generating into the temp DB, replicating to medic DB, and indexing views) has been measured at ~11,000 docs/min.\nWhile the speed gains of this approach are somewhat modest, it has a couple additional benefits:\nThe time spent running the actual generation script is minimal (since docs are added to the temp db at ~360,000 docs/min). Therefore, there is less risk of the script being interrupted or becoming disconnected from the CouchDB instance. Once all the docs are saved in the temp DB, the replication/indexing happens internally within the Couch instance. This is where the vast majority of the time is spent.

Consider using patches and the blocking or non-blocking decorations to further communicate your intent. issue - Issues highlight specific problems with the subject under review. These problems can be user-facing or behind the scenes. It is strongly recommended to pair this comment with a suggestion. If you are not sure if a problem exists or not, consider leaving a question. todo - TODO’s are small, trivial, but necessary changes. Distinguishing todo comments from issues: or suggestions: helps direct the reader’s attention to comments requiring more involvement. question - Questions are appropriate if you have a potential concern but are not quite sure if it’s relevant or not. Asking the author for clarification or investigation can lead to a quick resolution. thought - Thoughts represent an idea that popped up from reviewing. These comments are non-blocking by nature, but they are extremely valuable and can lead to more focused initiatives and mentoring opportunities. chore - Chores are simple tasks that must be done before the subject can be “officially” accepted. Usually, these comments reference some common process. Try to leave a link to the process description so that the reader knows how to resolve the chore. note - Notes are always non-blocking and simply highlight something the reader should take note of. Sample comments:\nIssue comment\nSuggestion comment","migrating#Migrating":"When the schema is changed you must also provide a migration so when instances are upgraded existing data is compatible with the new code.","opening-pull-requests#Opening Pull Requests":"Create a Draft Pull Request to facilitate discussion and collaboration with quality assistance engineers and developers.\nOnce you are confident that the change is complete and ready to be merged:\nChange the Pull Request from Draft to Ready for review.\nThe Pull Request title will be the commit message, it is important to follow the commit message format to name the Pull Request title properly.\nAdd a Pull Request description:\nAdd a description of changes, decisions, backstory, thinking process, and any extra information to facilitate the review process and reduce follow-ups. Add videos or screenshots of the tests you did before submitting the Pull Request. This increases understanding of the work and allows the reviewers to catch any uncovered case. Add the issue number, for example: medic/cht-core#123. Do a self-code review before asking for a review. This is a good practice, as you will almost always find things to fix. It saves a lot of time for you and the reviewers.\nPick one reviewer for the PR and work with them until the code passes review. It is okay to include one additional reviewer who has more experience in a particular subject.\nCoordinate with a QA engineer and add them as reviewers when you need specific quality/testing support. For example, when major changes or new features are introduced to the codebase, security-related changes are made, and substantial user experience improvements are required. The QA engineer can advise whether that needs to be considered in the current e2e suite, they can advise on edge cases or other scenarios to consider for testing. Follow up on your PR to keep momentum; the review should happen in 24h business days. If you haven’t received feedback from the reviewers after that time, check if they are available. Otherwise, it’s okay to request a review from another person.\nOnce the PR has been approved, wait for the GitHub Actions to succeed and ensure there are no conflicts with the main branch.\nDouble-check the commit message format is correct. Make sure to recognize collaboration in the commit description: Co-authored-by: .\nMerge your work by selecting Squash and merge. This will compress all the commits into one, keeping the repository’s commit history clean.\nIf a backport is required, cherry-pick the merged commit back to the release branches it is required in.","pull-requests#Pull Requests":"Never push commits directly to the main branch (main or master). Always use a pull request.\nIf your code is in a regular pull request, it is assumed to be done and only needing a review and testing as checks before merging. It is best to request a reviewer, but otherwise anyone may freely review your PR. If your code is in a draft PR, it is assumed to be a work-in-progress where collaboration is welcome, but best to communicate about specifics before assuming anything is complete. If you have pushed code to a remote branch without a pull request, it is assumed to be a work-in-progress where collaboration is unexpected. A good workflow would be to work locally, pushing to a remote branch as you make progress, possibly open a draft PR for some initial collaboration on tricky parts, and once everything is done, convert the draft PR to a regular PR to be reviewed.\nOnce your pull request has been approved, it can be merged to the main branch by anyone with write access to the repository.\nWhen merging a PR, avoid the “Create a merge commit” option. Merge commits in the main branch cause the history of the branch to be non-linear and make it more difficult to understand exactly when a code change was introduced. Instead, use the “Squash and merge” option to combine the commits in the PR into a single commit on the main branch. Alternatively, you can use the “Rebase and merge” option if you want all the commits in the PR to be preserved in the main branch (this should only be used in special cases).\nSee above for instructions on how to format your commit messages.","regressions#Regressions":"When a bug is found that impacts functionality that worked in a previous version, it’s important that this is labelled properly so someone who is planning to upgrade can find it. To flag this, add the “Regression” label, and a label in the form “Affects: {{version}}” (e.g.: “Affects: 3.14.0”) for each version where this bug exists. It’s likely that the label for this specific version doesn’t exist so you may have to create it. This ensures that issue is listed as a Known Issue in the Release Notes for that version.","suggestions#Suggestions":"When doing a code review aim to be extremely clear. This helps things move quickly and avoids lost time in misunderstandings. One especially useful GitHub feature for doing this is suggesting a change. Consider the following example code:\ncontacts.map( (c) =\u003e { return c.id }); The function body can be abbreviated. In a review you can leave a comment asking for the change, which would likely involve writing up a comment trying to have the author change it to the following:\ncontacts.map( c =\u003e c.id); That means leaving a comment, having the author read and understand it, and then making and pushing up a change, hopefully matching your review expectations.\nTo be clear and save all that back-and-forth though, you can make a code suggestion directly in your review, which will let the author simply click a button to accept the change (and have it automatically applied as a commit by GitHub).\nGitHub review suggest change","testing#Testing":"Reach out to the Quality Assurance Engineers with the work to be done as early as possible in the development process to ensure they are informed and can guide development (see more in the Quality Assistance dedicated page).\nBefore asking for testing support from the QA Engineers, you should test your work after performing it. Correcting a small code error, such as a typo, or adding a missing step in the testing instructions could save QA Engineers hours of work. Also, by testing your code, you may get a better sense of why you make certain common mistakes, and learn to avoid repeating them in the future.\nAll features and bug fixes must have at least one unit test. All features must have at least one end-to-end test.\nThe CHT Core has a fully automated end-to-end testing suite which is executed in CI and must pass before any change is merged. This means you can have reasonable confidence that all code merged to the main branch is safe and ready for release without further regression testing. The suite isn’t fully comprehensive but it is being constantly improved and expanded.\nFrom time to time QA Engineers will perform smoke tests, scalability tests, performance tests, and penetration tests to pick up on gradual regressions that may have crept in. The ultimate goal is that these tests will eventually be automated and added to the CI suite as well.\nUse the following template for QA feedback throughout the development.\nTest passedTest failed Test details Config: Environment: Platform: Browser: Test scenario: Description of the scenario - This is not required for all the tests\nReproducible on master A small description of how it was reproduced, and images or videos that support the comment.\nImage/video attached Fixed on ####-branch-name A small description, and images or videos that support the comment.\nImage/video attached Test passed successfully. ✅ The ticket is ready to merge. @\nTest details Config: Environment: Platform: Browser: Test scenario: Description of the scenario - This is not required for all the tests\nReproducible on master A small description of how it was reproduced, and images or videos that support the comment.\nImage/video attached Not working on ####-branch-name A small description, and images or videos that support the comment.\nImage/video attached Test failed ❌ The ticket needs further development. @","timeliness#Timeliness":"Timely code reviews are important to getting improvements into the hands of users faster and allowing developers to stay focused on the task at hand and see it through to production.\nCode reviews should be completed within 24 hours of assignment (excluding weekends and holidays). In some cases, a code review may not be possible if a larger discussion needs to be had for design choices or solution objectives, but even in cases like those, some feedback is still to be expected within 24 hours.","to-do#To do":"Issues in this column have been prioritised and are ready for development.

At this stage, the two to look out for are:\nBreaking change UI/UX Add a comment to the GitHub issue with what the final change actually was. This is important for multiple cases including:\nNon-technical people may not understand the conversation thread on the issue. GitHub is a place that developers work, but it is also common to send non-technical people links to issues in GitHub. The QA team should have a quick way to know where to start testing. Issues with a lot of discussion of alternative solutions need a clear resolution and indication of which route was taken. Options for doing this:\nAttach a short video - these are usually very well received and can often help people understand what happened much more clearly than a text description. Screenshots - pictures with big arrows on them can quickly convey important things to look at. If you start to need multiple screenshots consider the video option instead. Write up a few sentences - be sure to consider a non-technical audience when writing this. An example of a good thorough comment/template is as follows:\n### Testing 1.

(No technical knowledge/experience is needed to help with translations.)\nSee the localization documentation for more information on how to manage custom translations for a particular CHT instance.","adding-new-keys#Adding new keys":"When developing a new feature in CHT Core, any user-facing text must be translated. (Note: log messages are not considered “user-facing” as they will not be seen by end users and as such do not need to be translated.)\nIn the cht-core repository, the translations are stored in api/resources/translations. To add a new translation string:\nFirst check if an appropriate key already exists in messages-en.properties. Using existing keys when possible reduces the effort required to translate the app into a new language. Create a unique key to identify the translation string. The key should accurately describe the string’s purpose/usage. Add the key to each of the files contained in api/resources/translations. Include an English translation string for your key (and strings for any other languages you are proficient in). Leave the string empty for the other languages. Note the translation linting will fail for any empty strings in translation files for the languages marked as “Supported” in the table above. This is expected and the check should continue to fail until translations from the community are added (as described below). When you have completed the implementation of your new feature (and you are confident you know which translation strings are needed), make a new post in the Translation category on the CHT Community Forum requesting help from the community to translate the new strings. Include the key(s) and the English string(s) in your post, with a link to the issue/PR you are working on. You can also include any context/screenshots that may help the translators understand the string’s purpose. Add the additional translations from the community into the proper files in api/resources/translations.

The language code will be used to identify the language in the application. For instance, for English, we would have a translations/messages-en.properties file. Add the language to the LOCAL_NAME_MAP in api. Use the language code for the key, and the local name followed by the English name for the language in brackets, eg: “fr: ‘Français (French)’”. Import the moment language pack in the main.ts file. If moment doesn’t provide the required language pack you may need to contribute it upstream to the moment library. Import the bootstrap-datepicker language pack in the Enketo main.ts file. If bootstrap-datepicker doesn’t provide the required language pack you may need to create a custom language pack as in the Luganda language example.

Squad Formation: If there is enough collective interest and commitment, the squad formation process begins. This involves defining the squad’s objective, goals, and timeline. The original proposer often becomes the initial facilitator. From there, interested parties officially become squad members and begin the collaborative work. The facilitator should reach out to the CHT Stewardship Team to allocate dedicated time during Round-up or Community Meetup calls for sharing the initiative with the broader community.","kick-off#Kick off":"Once the squad members have a start date, organise a public, open kick-off meeting with all community members interested in contributing to the initiative.

Agreement on a recurring meeting cadence (for example, weekly/biweekly calls). Reach out to the CHT Stewardship Team to create a dedicated Slack channel for squad discussion. If Slack doesn’t suit for whatever reason, any other shared comms channel would be fine.

Due to our commitment to open-source, all the content of the Technology Radars is public on GitHub and open to the community to provide comments and suggestions.","for-contributors#For Contributors":"The CHT Technology Radar for Contributors provides a helpful view for developers to know what languages, tools, platforms, or techniques to use while contributing to CHT tools.\nWe categorized this radar’s content into four quadrants:\nLanguages \u0026 Frameworks: Include development languages and more low-level development frameworks, which help implement custom software of all kinds. Tools: These can be components, like databases, software development tools, such as version control systems. Techniques: Include elements of a software development process, such as continuous integration, and ways of creating software, such as progressive web applications. Platforms: There are things that we build software on top of, such as mobile technologies like Android or generic kinds of platforms like Amazon Web Services. We classify each of the items above in one of these rings:\nAdopt, Trial, Stop. These adoption degrees have the same usage recommendation as the ones for the CHT Technology Radar for Implementers above. Assess: The Assess ring contains items to look at closely, but not necessarily trial yet - unless you think they would be a particularly good fit for you. Typically, items in the Assess ring are interesting and worth keeping an eye on. You can learn how to contribute to the CHT Technical Radar for Contributors in the related GitHub repository.","for-implementers#For Implementers":"The CHT Technology Radar for Implementers provides a view of all CHT-related tools and components so that CHT implementers and application developers can decide which to use when designing, developing, and hosting their CHT applications.\nWe categorized this radar’s content into four quadrants:\nApp Building: These components help build CHT apps, like CHT Conf, and form preview/builder tools like XLSForm. CHT App Features: Aspects of CHT Core Framework that can be used in CHT Apps. These could include new CHT form widgets, updated UI elements like the floating action button, and user management features. Data Use: This includes tools and components used to manage data that comes in or out of the CHT. It also includes integrations, interoperability standards and methods, ETL, Pipeline, and querying techniques. Additionally, this quadrant contains visualization tools for dashboards. Deployment Management: Deploying and maintaining CHT instances takes considerable coordination, especially for large-scale deployments. This quadrant also includes key aspects for hosting, including tools and methods for alerts and monitoring. We classify each of the items above in one of these rings:\nAdopt: The Adopt ring represents tools that you should seriously consider using. We don’t say you should use these for every project; one should only use a tool in an appropriate context. However, an item in the Adopt ring represents something where there’s no doubt it’s proven and mature for use with the CHT. Trial: The Trial ring is for tools ready for use but only partially proven as those in the Adopt ring. You should use these on a trial basis to decide whether they should be part of your toolkit. Others may already be using these items in production, likely as early adopters of the tools. Stop: The Stop (or Not Recommended) ring is for things we think implementers should avoid using or look for ways to move off of. These include items for which a better alternative is available, or where the item is found to not work correctly with the CHT. You can learn how to contribute to the CHT Technical Radar for Implementers in the related GitHub repository."},"title":"Tech Radar"},"/design/":{"data":{"":"PersonasLearn who the CHT can be built for InterfaceUser interface and branding guide UX ResearchExplore guidelines for conducting user experience research Mapping HierarchyLearn how to map users on the CHT hierarchy Best PracticesBest practices when building your own community health app"},"title":"Design"},"/design/best-practices/":{"data":{"":"This section covers the configuration best practices of forms, tasks, targets, and contact profiles when building your own community health app.","always-stack-radio-buttons-and-checkboxes-in-a-single-vertical-column#Always Stack Radio Buttons And Checkboxes In A Single Vertical Column":"Placing the options underneath each other allows for easy scanning and makes it less likely that a user will completely overlook one of the options.\nRadio Buttons","anatomy-of-a-report#Anatomy of a Report":"Anatomy of a Report\nThe first line of bold text is the name of the person whom the Report is about.

When a task is finished, it will automatically clear from the Tasks list and move to Reports.\nAnatomy of a Task\nEach Task has an icon on the left side which indicates what type of Task it is. The first bold line of text is the name of the person or family that the Task is about. The second line of text is the title of the Task. The days left for the Task to be done is located in the upper right-hand corner. If a Task is overdue, the due date will be red. Tasks are listed in order of due date.","bars#Bars":"Has to have a numerator and a denominator – comparing two things, and not more than two at this time (can’t do: % of deliveries at (1) home unskilled vs. (2) home skilled vs. (3) facility. Any two of these would work though, including (1) all home deliveries vs. (2) facility deliveries). It is possible to account for things that haven’t happened. For example, if you are measuring PNC visits that happened within 1 week of delivery, you can determine whether a particular woman should have had a PNC visit based on her EDD. There are several ways to account for things that have and haven’t happened, and happened late, depending on what you are trying to show. Ex. Configurations for visit attendance: - Of all the visits that happened, how many were on-time? (doesn’t look for visits that didn’t happen) - On-time = true, Late = false - Of all the visits that were supposed to happen, how many were on-time? - On-time = true, Late + didn’t happen = false - Of all the visits that were supposed to happen, how many actually occurred? (includes on-time and late as having happened) - On-time + Late = true, Didn’t happen = false It’s not possible to total up forms from all household members or check to see if any family member had a form submitted this week and count that as the household being visited. If you want to count the households visited this month, you need a form submitted at the household level like a household visit form or a household survey form. Denominator must be the same for both sides (e.g. kids in our immunization program). Can’t split it into kids \u003c2 yrs on one side and kids \u003c5 years on the other side.

Ex. Pregnancy Card, Immunization Card Consider what a user will do with the information before deciding to display it. More info isn’t necessarily better; what does a CHW need to know and how will they change their actions as a result?\nPast condition cards may be best displayed as a summary of multiple past conditions rather than individual conditions\nEx. Summary of past pregnancies rather than card for each past pregnancy Past Pregnancies","distinguish-optional-and-required-fields#Distinguish Optional And Required Fields":"Users don’t always know what is implied by the required field marker ( * ). Instead, denoting what is optional is a preferred method, especially for forms with many required fields.

LMP, EDD, most recent case of malaria, past pregnancies and their delivery dates Can display Notes Data can be displayed in the following formats: Number Count towards a goal Percentage Date Text field Fields in cards are dynamic and will update as new information is submitted Ex. # of ANC visits so far, change in risk status Fields can include icons Ex. High risk status on an Active Pregnancy card Icons should be selected from Medic’s icon library and should be displayed at our standard 30 x 30 px size Displaying Cards\nCan be configured to show and hide at the appropriate time Ex. Show the EDD of the current pregnancy until a delivery Report is received, show that a child is being treated for malnutrition until the treatment is complete, show that a child had malaria until 2 weeks after diagnosis Condition cards can be configured to disappear at the end of the condition or persist for any length of time\nCan be added to a person or place profile\nEx. Equity scorecard on household profile; CHW performance scorecard on CHW profile","field-label#Field Label":"Label each data point displayed One line","forms#Forms":"We use forms to build the Tasks, Care Guides, and Reports that take health workers through care protocols and provide decision support for their interactions with patients.\nIn this context, a form is any document with questions and blank spaces or selectable options for answers. Forms can be found in many parts of your app including the Tasks, People, and Reports tabs\nWhile both Tasks and Reports are built with forms, there are key differences. Tasks are blank forms that need to be completed, while Reports are forms that have already been submitted. When a Task is completed and submitted, it automatically becomes a Report.\nNote: The icons and titles that we choose for Tasks remain the same when they become Reports.","general-section-order#General Section Order":"Not all forms will have all summary sections, but the sections that appear should be in this order:\nReminder: “To finish, be sure to click the Submit button at the bottom of the form.” Patient details (name, age etc.) Visit information (summarizes the info that was just captured in the form) Signs and symptoms (if applicable) Refer to a health facility warning message (if applicable) Diagnosis and treatment (if applicable) Healthy tips/educational info (if applicable) Follow-ups scheduled (if applicable) Submit button","group-related-information#Group Related Information":"Users think in batches, and long forms can feel overwhelming. By creating logical groups the user will make sense of the form much faster.\nEx. Visit Details, Danger Signs","guidelines#Guidelines":"","guidelines-1#Guidelines":"","header-color#Header Color":"Though it may be tempting to give each section has a unique color (e.g. “Patient Details” is yellow, “Healthy Tips” is blue etc), sometimes there are too many sections for each one to have its own color, other times the various colors just look jarring and confusing. In general, you should strive to use color in a way that adds meaning and improves understanding, and avoid using color in a purely decorative manner.\nOnly use the bright red color to call out important things like warnings and danger signs If you choose to use multiple header colors, ensure that every header is a unique color. For example: yellow: #e2b100 - patient details blue: #6b9acd - visit information and key health messages lime: #b5bd21 - child health red: #e00900 - warnings and danger signs green: #75b2b2 - follow up (at the end) If you find you have more sections than you do colors, it may be best to just make all the headers a single color (with the exception of warnings or referral messages, which should remain red). In this case, blue is a good default color to fall back on.","header-icons#Header Icons":"Each section header should have an icon on the far left side. The icons should all be colored white, and should all be the same size. These icons should be unique for each section (no repeat icons)\nSuggested icons for each section:\nIcon Section Patient Details Visit Information Pregnancy Specific Child Health Specific Signs and Symptoms Warnings and Referrals Diagnosis and Treatment Follow-Ups Misc/General","header-text#Header Text":"The text inside of the section headers should be “H1”: Noto Sans 18px bold The text should be centered vertically \u0026 horizontally in the bar Each section header title should be Title Case, meaning each word is capitalized e.g. “Patient Details”","icons#Icons":"The Community Health Toolkit includes a collection of 60+ free icons that represent key elements of different community health workflows and protocols.

They make the page easier to scan and they make it easier to find a specific section.\nThere are suggested orders, colors and icons for section headers. A section should only be visible if it contains content (ie. headers should never be stacked directly on top of each other).\nTo ensure that headers only show when they have content the relevant condition for the section header should join the conditions of all the subfields.\nEx. {condition_a} OR {condition_b} OR {condition_c}","subtitle#Subtitle":"The subtitle is where timeframe information lives, expressed as either “This month” or “All-time”. For now, these are the only two options. All text should be set in sentence case.","summary-page#Summary Page":"After all of the required questions in a form are answered, a summary page is displayed. Here, health workers can review the information they entered into the form, receive instructions for treatment, care, and referrals, and relay detailed educational information to the patient.\nNote: The form is not submitted until the user scrolls to the end of the page and clicks “Submit”.\nAll care guides are defined using ODK XForms, an XML definition of the structure and format for a set of questions. Since writing raw XML can be tedious, we suggest creating the forms using the XLSForm standard, and using the cht-conf command line configurer tool to convert them to XForm format. Because the XLSForms are converted directly to XForms, they essentially are the form, and so it’s important that the XLS be set up properly and consistently. Read more about configuring forms here.","targets#Targets":"The Targets tab shows key performance indicators.

No need to include “%”, the word “percent”, or the word “count” (these are stated elsewhere) or any information on timeframe. Titles should be 40-50 characters max. All text should be set in sentence case (meaning the first letter of first word is capitalized, all other words lowercase, except for acronyms) If hyphenation is needed, words should only be broken at syllables Ex. - % Newborn Care Visit Within 72 hours → Newborn visits within 3 days - % of Under-5 Referrals Followed-up within 24 hours → U5 referral follow-ups within 1 day - % of Fever Tested with mRDT → Fever tested with mRDT - Pregnancies Registered This Month → Pregnancies registered - Births This Month → New births - Deliveries at Facility All Time → Deliveries at facility","titles#Titles":"The patient’s name should not be included in the form title.\n❌ Don't do this: \"Beatrice Bass Delivery Follow-Up\" ✅ Do this instead: \"Delivery Follow-Up\" Avoid generic words like “Visit” or “Report”. Every form can be a Report and often involves a visit, so including these words in the title doesn’t help differentiate it from other forms.\n❌ Don't do this: \"Delivery Follow-up Visit\" ✅ Do this instead: \"Delivery Follow-Up\" Each word in a title should be capitalized (Title Case).\n❌ Don't do this: \"Delivery follow-up\" ✅ Do this instead: \"Delivery Follow-Up\" Keep form titles short and concise. Long titles will sometimes be truncated (cut off with an ellipsis) and the text at the end of the title might be lost. As a rough estimate, strive to keep titles no longer than 40 characters in length.\n❌ Don't do this: \"This Title Has Way More Than Forty Characters And Is Too Long\" ✅ Do this instead: \"Title Is Less Than Forty Characters\" To help estimate how much text can be displayed before truncation, you can use the low-fi mockups here. If you type your form name into the mockup you can get a rough idea of how much text will fit before truncation occurs. Note that the mockups have been made with our smallest screen sizes in mind. Some users’ screens will be larger and will be able to display more text.\nThe screenshots here represent some of the smallest phones our users have. As you can see, on both the Tasks and Reports pages, titles less than about forty characters will fit in the space. Titles longer than about forty characters might be cut off with an ellipsis (…).\nHistory","unique-considerations-for-personas#Unique Considerations for Personas":"CHWs:\nWill be viewing on a mobile device; keep in mind the number of widgets you display Information is related to their own individual achievement, not comparisons with peers or aggregates for their facility May have a difficult time understanding percentages (however certain partners like LG still focus on % based targets and therefore it still needs to be included). Percentages are good for evaluating performance, but difficult to “act on” because depending on how many actions you have already done / left to do, it may not always be clear or possible to “achieve” a percentage goal.

In the rainy season — when diarrhea is often worse — these roads flood. Janet does not visit homes on these days.\nDuring her visits Janet carries her register, an education booklet, drugs and other sales material in her bag which is very heavy.

She takes her son to school which is on her way to health center where she is based.\nShe needs to be at the health center by 9 am so she takes a bus for part of the journey and a motorbike for the rest of the journey. The health center is located about 10 km from her home.\nShe attends to her public health officer’s duties based at the health center. She is primarily in charge of the community and market sanitation, so she facilitates the small scale traders who run business at the nearby market to get health check-ups that are mandatory before she issues them a certified health certificate that allows them to run food related businesses in the market.\nIn the course of her day, she collaborates with a wide range of stakeholders in order to perform her chores. She liaises with the clinicians and nurses to identify defaulters of care in order to organize for the follows up through the community health workers. The nurse would give her a list of children who have missed their vaccine appointments, the pregnant women who have missed their antenatal care clinics, the Tuberculosis and HIV/AIDs clinicians also have a list of defaulters of care that should be followed to ensure prompt care. She must liaises with the CHWs to be trace these patients and reintroduce them to care. This is one of her greatest challenge as it is hard to trace the children in the wide facility catchment area. You know it is her responsibility to ensure that the community health workers are creating demand for the health services at the community level and ensuring that the community members access the quality care at the health facilities. She assesses the performance of her CHWs by looking at how many community members they refer to the health facilities for care, and the adherence to care of the patients referred by each CHW. This is no mean easy task as CHWs are not paid and the villages they cover are wide and a very hilly terrain which becomes impossible during the rainy weather. Over half of the CHWs that she trained during the initiation of the CHW program in her area three years have dropped, and the new ones she has replaced need to be trained on the whole package of their role. She would gladly do this but “Oh, when will an non governmental organization come by to support us in this capacity building activity?” She exclaims. Meanwhile she must support the new CHWs by accompanying them at least once a month when they are doing their household visits in the villages.\nSince there is an upcoming community based polio and tetanus campaign targeted for under-fives and women of reproductive health, she must select and contact several CHWs from each village that will help them administer these vaccines in their villages and therefore reach the most possible target population.\nShe must also liaise with the area administrative chief who provide the go ahead of the community based activities to mobilize the community for health education and dialogue days and community health related activities. She and her CHWs lead the community to discuss on various disease preventive and health promotive activities that are tailored to meet health needs/gaps they have observed within the community. They use these regular forums to reinforce important health messages like the importance pregnant women going for ANC and children for immunization. She leads the community health workers and community members during community action days.\nShe also works hand in hand with the schools heads for deworming and Vitamin A campaign targeted at children, a regular activity which she carries out with the CHWs.\nAnn’s 80% of her time is spent interacting with the community and the community health workers. This month’s monthly meeting with the CHWs is early next week. She must make some time to prepare some notes on how to make drinking water safe for use in the community, during a visit in the community, she observed that the community was using unsafe water for drinking and the CHW did not know what to advise her households to make the water safe. The CHEW continues to offer need based training to the CHWs depending on assessment of the knowledge deficits of the CHWs after the initial training. He guides the CHWs, on how to effectively communicate well with the community. She intents to guide the CHWs on the data items to collect as most of them have not been sending all the reports as required. If transport within the community was cheap or easier she would visit the CHWs who did not send reports and or those who send inaccurate data or incomplete reports and walk with them as they collect the data.. As a CHEW, she is charged by the MOH to aggregate data about the community’s state of health that is received from the CHWs on a monthly basis. The primary data items for her reflect the utilization of health services by the community.\nAnn has a regular end of month meeting with her community health supervisor who is based in the Sub district hospital that is 150km away from her station early in the morning on Wednesday. She must prepare and present her monthly written reports and give a verbal report of the state of the community and performance of the CHWs under her supervision.\nAnn gets back to her home at 6 pm, she picks her son from school where he had been playing since 4pm when the other pupils leave school for home. She prepares supper for her family, and carries out the other family chores.

It is a regular practice to carry out health education sessions to the out patients. She will also talk to the CHEW today for a health education session with the CHWs during their monthly meeting on cholera prevention that the CHWs must disseminate to the community. She and the field CHEW must liaise consistently as they work together with the CHWs to promote the health of the community. Her role is to oversee the field CHEW and to help her meet the knowledge gap of the CHWs by consistently teaching CHWs on common local diseases and how to prevent them, identifying them, giving first aid and referring patients for specialized health care.\nThe CHWs are critical to her as they are the link between the community and the health facility that is very important.

She briefly counsels on how to take care of herself during pregnancy, feed well and the exercises to take, maintain good hygiene and to plan to deliver her baby in the health facility: the individual birth plan, must be reinforced by the CHWs who can afford some more time for a one to one talk with the woman.

CouchDB, which is the database used by the CHT, is not designed for analytics. It is a document database, which means that it is optimized for storing and retrieving documents, and not for aggregating data. For example, if you wanted to know how many patients were registered in a particular area, you would have to query the database for all the patients in that area, and then count them. This is not a very efficient process. It is much more efficient to store the number of patients in a particular area in a separate database, and update that number whenever a patient is registered or unregistered. This is what CHT Sync is designed to do.\nCHT Sync is an integrated solution designed to enable data synchronization between CouchDB and PostgreSQL for the purpose of analytics. It has been designed to work in both local development environments for testing models or workflows, and in production environments. It can be deployed using Docker or Kubernetes. It is supported on CHT 3.12 and later, including CHT 4.x. By using CHT Sync, a CHT deployment can easily get analytics by using a data visualization tool, such as Superset.

It initially stores the document data from CouchDB in a jsonb column in a single PostgreSQL table. This is not possible to query for analytics, so it uses dbt to convert the document data to a relational database format.\nThe cht-pipeline repository defines a dbt project, which contains model files for the data schema described in the database schema conventions. Forms may be specific to each CHT application; additional models will need to be developed to analyze data from responses to these custom forms. One additional model will be needed for each form, and for any aggregations, dashboards, or reusable views that use those form responses as input. If using the configurable contact hierarchy, it may also be useful to add models for other contact types.","aggregations#Aggregations":"After defining the form and contact models, they can be joined together by subject (patient_id or place_id), reported_by, or any of the other contact fields, to build aggregates of form submissions grouped by report date, area, or reporter.\nIt may be useful to save some common queries as views, so that they can be reused in dashboards or downstream aggregations.

The database will grow over time as more data is added to CouchDB. The database should be monitored to ensure that it has enough space to accommodate the data. To get an idea of the size requirements of the database, you can replicate 10% of the data from CouchDB to Postgres and then run the following command to see disk usage:\nSELECT pg_size_pretty(pg_database_size('your_database_name')); If Postgres is running in a Kubernetes cluster, you can use the following command to get the disk usage:\nkubectl exec -it postgres-pod-name -- psql -U postgres -c \"SELECT pg_size_pretty(pg_database_size('your_database_name'));\" To get the percentage of documents that have synced you can run the following query in your Postgres database:\nSELECT (COUNT(*) * 100 / (COUNT(*) + (SELECT SUM(pending) FROM v1.couchdb_progress))) AS sync_percentage FROM v1.couchdb; This query selects the total number of documents that have been synced to the v1.couchdb table and divides it by the total number of documents that have been synced and the number of documents that are pending to be synced. This will give you the percentage of documents that have been synced. Note that the schema and table name could differ according to the environment variables you set so update them accordingly. Run this query periodically to monitor the progress of the sync and stop the sync process once you get to the desired percentage. It’s okay if it is not exactly 10% as long as it is close enough to give you an idea of the disk space required.\nYou can then multiply this figure by 10 to get an estimate of the disk space required for the full dataset and then add some extra space for indexes and other overhead as well as future growth.\nFor example if the size of the database is 1GB, you can expect the full dataset to be around 10GB. If the CouchDB docs grow by 20% every year then you can compound this growth over 5 years to get an estimate of the disk space required: 10GB * 1.2^5 = 18.5GB. You can add an extra 20% for indexes and overhead to get an estimate of 22.2GB.\nThis is just an estimate and the actual disk space required may vary so actively monitoring the disk space usage and making necessary adjustments is recommended.","deploying-models#Deploying models":"CHT Sync automatically checks for updates to the dbt project at CHT_PIPELINE_BRANCH_URL.

Generally, these changes will be backwards compatible so that a new release of the CHT, or to the base models, does not break application specific models.\nWhen it is necessary to update the base models, update the version tag in the dependency that refers to cht-pipeline, make any changes to application specific models that are necessary, rerun any unit tests, and push to the main branch to release.","document_metadata#\u003ccode\u003edocument_metadata\u003c/code\u003e":"This table contains the metadata about all documents and is the root for all other models.

In short, views are normal SQL views, and incremental tables are actual tables, which are periodically updated as new data is created, updated or deleted.\nFor CHT dbt models, it is generally preferred to start with materialized views. Materialized views are refreshed on every dbt run, columns can still be indexed, and they don’t require much extra configuration. Non-materialized views or non-incremental tables are possible but not recommended because they are unavailable during dbt run and anything that depends on them (including dashboards) will also be unavailable. Some base models use incremental tables to ensure good performance for dbt run, because materialized views can take a long time to refresh.\nTo convert a view to an incremental table, change the materialization to incremental and add a condition to the WHERE clause:\n{{ config(materialized = 'incremental') unique_key='uuid', indexes=[ {'columns': ['\"uuid\"'], 'type': 'hash'}, {'columns': ['\"saved_timestamp\"'], 'type': 'btree'} ] }} SELECT uuid, \"saved_timestamp\", ...

One of the main changes in this flow is separating the syncing process from the data transformation, with dbt now handling the latter in cht-pipeline. This migration requires dbt models in the cht-pipeline repository instead of SQL views and tables. One thing to note is that the schema for CHT Sync differs from cht-couch2pg, so dbt models will not directly replace the SQL views and tables. For instructions on how to get started with dbt models, refer to the dbt models guide.","key-considerations#Key Considerations":"Kubernetes vs Docker Compose: CHT Sync provides configurations to support deployment to test and production environments with Docker Compose or Kubernetes. You can read more about the CHT hosting options in the dedicated page. Server resources: To minimize downtime, running both couch2pg and CHT Sync in parallel during the migration process is recommended. With this in mind, ensure that the server and database resources are sufficient to handle the load. dbt modelling: Avoid the temptation to model new dbt models after existing SQL views and tables. Instead, take the opportunity to re-evaluate the data needs and design new models that are more efficient and effective. Think of what data needs to be shown and how it should be shown in data visualization tools and use that to guide the design of the new models. Testing: After migrating, thoroughly test the new dbt models to ensure that they work as expected. Refer to the testing dbt models guide for guidelines on testing. Feedback: Provide any feedback and create issues for errors or bugs encountered in the cht-sync and cht-pipeline repositories to improve the tools.","migration-steps#Migration Steps":"Plan the migration: Determine the scope of the migration, including the data sources, the data models, and the data transformations. Identify the existing SQL views, tables, and dashboards and assess what data you want to visualize. Set up CHT Sync: Follow the instructions to setup CHT Sync with Docker Compose or Kubernetes Build dbt models: Use the dedicated guidelines to build dbt models for the data you want to visualize. Deploy CHT Sync: Once the dbt models are tested locally or in a test environment and working as expected, deploy CHT Sync in a production environment. It is recommended that CHT Sync be run in parallel with couch2pg during the migration process. This minimises disruption to users of the existing dashboards because they can continue to use the existing data while the new pipeline is being set up. It also makes it easier to compare the data from couch2pg when testing the new pipeline. Create replica dashboards: In the data visualization tool of your choice, create replica dashboards of your current setup and compare the data from the old and new pipelines. Test and adjust the dbt models: Test the dbt models to ensure they are working as expected and that the replica and initial dashboards match. Adjust the models to ensure they are accurate. Optimize: Once the dbt models are working as expected and the dashboards display the expected data, optimize the models to improve performance. This may involve restructuring the models, adding indexes, or making other adjustments to improve the speed and efficiency of the models. Having a look at the dbt models guide will help you understand how to optimize the models. Set up monitoring and alerting: Set up CHT Watchdog to monitor the running of CHT Sync and set up alerts for any failures. Remove couch2pg and the duplicate database: Once the new pipeline runs as expected, you can remove couch2pg and the duplicate database. Ensure that all data is being synced correctly, that the dbt models are working as expected, and that the dashboards display the expected data before switching them off and removing couch2pg."},"title":"couch2pg to CHT Sync"},"/hosting/analytics/dashboards/":{"data":{"":"These instructions assume you are running CHT Sync, CHT Core and PostgreSQL either with Kubernetes or Docker.","superset#Superset":"To build data visualization dashboards, follow the Superset instructions to run Superset and connect it to the PostgreSQL database.

The DBT_BATCH_SIZE variable can be used to limit the number of records inserted in a single dbt run, which allows models to catch up to real-time gradually and progressively. Batch size can be tuned to reduce the duration of a single dbt run, but setting it too small will not have a significant effect, and models will not be able to catch up to real-time if the batch size is smaller than the number of records added to the couchdb table during a single dbt run.\nA sensible default is DBT_BATCH_SIZE=100000.","multiple-dbt-containers#Multiple dbt containers":"Instead of a single dbt container that runs all models, CHT Sync supports having multiple dbt containers that each run a different set of models independently. This can be useful if any custom models take a long time to update; by running some models independently from others, faster models can complete before the slower models are finished.\nEach dbt container is passed an environment variable DBT_SELECTOR that is used as a --select argument to the dbt command.\nOne dbt container should be set up to run the base models. This can be done by using the selector package:cht_pipeline_base or, to separate telemetry models from base models, use tag:base and tag:users.\nTo run custom models in separate containers, either use a package select with your dbt package name (package:[YOUR_PACKAGE_NAME]), or for more fine-grained control, add tags to your models and use tag selectors (tag:[YOUR_TAG]). Although it is possible to use any condition, using tags is the simplest way to separate models.\nHow to configure the different dbt containers to use these selectors depends on whether CHT Sync is running in docker-compose or kubernetes.\nIn Kubernetes, add the selectors to the values.yaml file as a list called dbt_selectors\ndbt_selectors: - \"package:cht_pipeline_base\" - \"tag:tag-one\" - \"tag:tag-two\" This will create one pod per selector.\nWith docker compose, create a new docker compose file and include one dbt container per selector.","threads#Threads":"The DBT_THREADS variable can be used to allow dbt to run independent models concurrently in the same process using threads.\nThis can allow models to update more quickly by reducing the total duration of a dbt run.\nMore threads means more database processes running concurrently which can create performance issues; this value is per process, so if running separate processes, the total number of concurrent processes in the db will be DBT_THREADS x the number of processes.

While Watchdog can be set up to monitor CHT Core instances - which monitoring system will be used to alert on OS level warnings? Power failures and unplanned restarts - Will the server cleanly restart such that the CHT resumes service correctly? Backups - What happens to the CHT data if there’s a hard drive failure? Are there provisions for a 3-2-1 backup strategy? See the backup docs for more information. Disaster Recovery - What happens if there is a flood at the facility and on-site active and backup data are destroyed? Scale - What happens when the hardware deployed needs to be upgraded to increase capacity? Updates - CHT Core updates happen many times throughout the year - do you have a maintenance schedule for these and staff who are trained to do the upgrade? Renewals - Services such as TLS certificates and domains name registration expire periodically and will make the server inaccessible - do you have a schedule for monitoring and renewing these in a timely manner? Security - While the TLS certificate will protect data on the Internet, is the server hard drive encrypted in the event of property theft? Is there a sufficient policy in place when generating and handling passwords for CHWs? Have you considered Token Login to further reduce risk? Privacy - The CHT inherently carries sensitive patient medical information in the database. Are there sufficient measures in place to protect this sensitive data?"},"title":"Considerations"},"/hosting/cht/costs/":{"data":{"":"","accuracy#Accuracy":"This research was based on live instances so the costs are realistic. However, since not all programs use the CHT in the exact same way, and not all deployments have the same number of users and workflows, these numbers are still subject to some fluctuation.\nFurther, the costs in the table above only cover the variable costs. That is, the costs incurred of actual usage with in an EKS cluster. In a multi-tenant deployment with multiple instances (for example: Staging, User Acceptance Testing and Production), this can be critical to know what the three different deployments incurred costs are within the EKS cluster.\nImportantly, all production CHT 4.x deployments have a fixed cost to run the EKS cluster or generic Kubernetes if not on AWS. This is because all clusters contain servers that are always on and fully available. This cost is not yet included in this document.","cost-per-cht-per-month#Cost per CHT per Month":"In a production environment, the CHT costs are estimated at USD$0.10 per active user per month to run. What exactly does this mean? Let’s dive into some specifics which importantly cover what is include and excluded and how these costs can vary with each deployment.\nBe sure to read the Accuracy section so you understand what the costs on these page mean for your deployment.","excluded#Excluded":"There are many assumptions about what else is needed to run the CHT. While important, they are excluded:\nKubernetes cluster - Large, multi-tenant deployments in a Kubernetes cluster will have a fixed monthly cost to operate, including the worker nodes which may be large in size (RAM \u0026 CPU). Backups - Regular snapshots of the production data will need to be taken to ensure there is no data loss in case of catastrophic failure of server hardware. This takes up a disk space which should be accounted for when budgeting to host the CHT. Building a Datacenter (DC) - While some well funded MoH’s may have the budget and time to build a complete data center, this is out of the scope for this calculation. Therefore it is assumed an existing DC will be used or cloud hosting will be used. In the case where a MoH wants to build a DC, a competent 3rd party should be selected Training of Systems Administrators/IT - System administrator IT systems that have not used Kubernetes or have not hosted the CHT, will need to be trained on how to do both. Training of Trainers (ToT) and user Training Data Warehousing \u0026 Dashboards - While close to “Servers” above, not all deployments have a data warehouse (CHT Sync + Postgres) and dashboards (Superset/Klipfolio) at launch. These are easy to add on at a later date and cost can be estimated at that time. Upfront Purchase of Hardware - It is assumed that a deployment will either be using cloud based solutions or using managed bare metal, so these costs don’t apply. App Development - Each deployment needs to have the default CHT app customized for each of the required workflows. Smartphones - Device purchase, setup, and distribution for users to use the CHT. Analog -\u003e Digital Workflow conversion - The process of documenting paper processes in places that the CHT will replace. SMS - Some projects need the ability to send SMS to users from the CHT. Interoperability - While the CHT supports this out of the box - development work is needed to ensure it works with the specific 3rd party systems. Mobile Device Management - optional. Cellphone telecom services - Users actually uploading/downloading data Setup and/or transfer of hosting provider","how-the-number-was-calculated#How the number was calculated":"Medic hosts a number of production CHT instances in Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS). By using OpenCost, Medic can closely monitor real world costs with actual end users. OpenCost was used to separate one deployment’s CPU, RAM and disk use from another’s despite them all running in a multi-tenant EKS cluster.\nHere’s costs for two week period for an actual production instance which informs our USD$0.10 per active user per month cost, including a bit of over-provisioning to give a deployment some headroom:\nTotal Monthly Cost $68 Active Users (30 days) 661 $/User $0.10 RAM $22 CPU $8 Storage $24 Over provision $14 We derive the $/User/Month cost by taking $68/mo and dividing it by 661 active users to arrive at $0.10. The bottom 4 lines are the sub-items that make the total $68/mo amount. Note that if a deployment has a lot of active users, but a slower database growth than shown above, it can cause changes in costs mentioned in the next section.\nBy using OpenCost, we not only know costs as shown above, but we also know actual resources used with in the cluster. This allows us to be able to know CPU, storage and RAM usage. At a higher level, we can also know how many documents were stored and document growth. Documents are created, for example, when a CHW follows a health workflow on their device and synchronizes to the CHT:\nMonthly Resources CPU 8 RAM (Gigs) 15 Storage (TBs) 0.42 Documents 10.7M Documents Growth 248.0K","included#Included":"Items that are included in the basic costs of hosting the CHT:\nServers - Given the large number of hosted CHT instances this is the area with the most data to use to build the calculator. This includes: Average monthly cost to host the CHT Ability to adjust based on expected user count, number of workflows and a few other program specific numbers like how many workflows there are. Amount of CPU/RAM/Storage needed - while it is assumed this will be for AWS, it will come in the form of something like “20 vCPUs” which can be translated to any hosting environment. Built in overprovisioning to allow for bursts and a bit of growth Monitoring and Alerting - Since all software fails eventually, you need to be prepared to defend against this with aggressive monitoring and alerting. The goal will be to fix the problem before any users notice. Ingress/Egress - This is the ability to send and receive data to the CHT. Pricing from Datacenters and Cloud is readily available and “Servers” above can not exist without it. CHT Core updates and system maintenance - Both the CHT and underlying operating system will be upgraded on a regular basis. This not only ensures there are no security vulnerabilities, but also ensures the deployments gains the benefit of new features and performance gains in the CHT. Active users - this is the total amount of users that engage with the CHT every day. If there are credentials that are created, but no users logging in with those credentials, these do not increase costs.","monthly-costs#Monthly costs":"Item Cost Count Total/mo Note EC2 t4g.small $0.01/hr 1 $8 Control-plane node EC2 c6g.2xlarge $0.32/hr 3 $692 Worker nodes EBS SSD (gp3) $0.09/mo 500 $45 500GB of shared storage TOTAL $745/mo* * These estimates are as of 2024.","on-going-costs-and-growth#On-going costs and growth":"When running a small instance, be sure to plan for future costs. Do not assume that costs will stay flat or go down. Assume they will go up. Areas where costs can increase are:\nBackups - As your CouchDB instance takes more and more room, backups will cost more and more to store. Storage - As with backups, if the 500GB of storage approaches being full, or upgrades require a burst of disk use, plan on adding more active storage. More users - offline and online CHT Core users increase the load on the system. Be prepared to either add more worker nodes or increase the size of existing worker nodes to add more CPU and RAM. As well, consider stronger CPUs which might have higher clock speeds, more cache and be more efficient.","production-vs-development#Production vs Development":"A production deployment means the CHT is hosted either at a cloud provider or in a datacenter. Both provide high quality connectivity, power and cooling so the cost is higher than a development instance. This ensures users do not have service interruptions and can continue to have trust the CHT will be up when they need to deliver care.\nWhen analyzing the hosting total cost of ownership (TCO), only production instances were looked at.\nNote\nA development environment can be no cost (or very low cost). Assuming a developer already has a laptop, this is all that is needed to host a development instance.","small-deployment-example-costs#Small deployment example costs":"In order to get a better idea of fixed monthly costs, let’s look at the smallest Kubernetes deployment per the requirements docs. These estimates use Amazon’s EC2 pricing and EBS pricing in Paris (eu-west2) availability zone.

This serviceAccount restricts the upgrade-service from interacting with any other cht-core projects outside of its namespace, and gives the upgrade-service permissions to talk to kubernetes API to upgrade container images when a CHT ADMIN clicks upgrade through the Admin interface. Ingress - This is what forwards traffic to a particular project or pods. In most use-cases, there is an nginx deployed outside of the k3s cluster than contains DNS entries for existing projects, and contains a proxy_pass parameter to send traffic based on host header to any of the k3s server IPs. Inside the k3s cluster, the traefik container and servicelb-traefik containers in kube-system namespace will handle forwarding traffic to the correct cht-core containers based on url Persistent Volume Claim - This is where our project data will be stored. Important to ensure you have configured this correctly, with retain policies intact so the data is not deleted if the project is removed. It’s also vital to ensure you have a backup policy either set-up in VMware vCenter GUI or you have configured the csi-snapshotter that comes with vSphere CSI.

Instead of provisioning one VM per CHT Core project, we will provision larger VMs and deploy multiple CHT Core projects on one VM, with each project receiving optional resource limitations, like CPU and RAM.\nIn this example an orchestrator is deploying 50 CHT Core projects, one for each county. We will provision 9 large VMs and place 6 CHT Core projects on each VM. This allows for spare resources for failovers and lets the orchestrator decide on which VM projects live.

ConfigMaps - This contains configuration files, or credentials that containers can retrieve. If you edit the configmap, you should delete containers, which will trigger a new container to download your new edits to any configurations for that service ServiceAccounts - This is used by the upgrade-service that is running inside the cht-core pods (as a container titled upgrade-service). This serviceAccount restricts the upgrade-service from interacting with any other cht-core projects outside of its namespace, and gives the upgrade-service permissions to talk to kubernetes API to upgrade container images when a CHT ADMIN clicks upgrade through the Admin interface. Ingress - This is what forwards traffic to a particular project or pods. In most use-cases, there is an nginx deployed outside of the k3s cluster than contains DNS entries for existing projects, and contains a proxy_pass parameter to send traffic based on host header to any of the k3s server IPs. Inside the k3s cluster, the traefik container and servicelb-traefik containers in kube-system namespace will handle forwarding traffic to the correct cht-core containers based on url Persistent Volume Claim - This is where our project data will be stored. Important to ensure you have configured this correctly, with retain policies intact so the data is not deleted if the project is removed. It’s also vital to ensure you have a backup policy either set-up in VMware vCenter GUI or you have configured the csi-snapshotter that comes with vSphere CSI. Services - This is utilized for CouchDB nodes to discover each other through DNS rather than internal IPs, which can change. This is also used in the COUCH_URL so API containers can discover where CouchDB is running.","network#Network":"Ensure the above provisioned VMs:\nabide by Inbound Rules for k3s Server Nodes If you’re using Ubuntu’s ufw, follow firewall considerations for k3s on Ubuntu are restricted to the IP addresses of the k3s nodes so only they can connect to the service ports","nodes#Nodes":"We’ll be using two types of k3s nodes in this deployment:\nHA control-plane nodes - these enable high availability (HA) and provide access to kube API.

They will also run services that tie in networking and storage. VMware CSI-node will be running here which enables agents to mount volumes from VMware Virtual-SAN for block data storage.

This tool interfaces with CouchDb, to update shard maps and database metadata.\nBy the end of this guide, your CHT-Core 3.x CouchDb will be down and CHT-Core 4.x ready to be used. Using this tool is not required, and the same result can be achieved by calling CouchDb endpoints directly. Consult CouchDB documentation for details about moving shards.\nTip\nIf after upgrading you get an error, Cannot convert undefined or null to object - please see issue #8040 for a work around. This only affects CHT 4.0.0, 4.0.1, 4.1.0 and 4.1.1. It was fixed in CHT 4.2.0.\n1. Install CHT data migration tool Open your terminal and run these commands. They will create a new directory, download a docker compose file and download the required docker image.\nmkdir -p ~/couchdb-migration/ cd ~/couchdb-migration/ curl -s -o ./docker-compose.yml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/medic/couchdb-migration/main/docker-compose.yml docker compose up For the following steps, the tool needs access to your CouchDb installation. To allow this access, you will need to provide a URL to your CouchDB installation that includes authentication. If your installation exposes a different port for CouchDb cluster API endpoints, export that port. If running against an installation of MedicOS, make sure that the protocol of the URL is https.\nexport COUCH_URL=http(s)://@: For simplicity, you could store these required values in an .env file:\ncat \u003e ${HOME}/couchdb-migration/.env \u003c\u003c EOF COUCH_URL=http(s)://@: EOF 2. Prepare CHT-Core 3.x installation for upgrading Backup your data! If you encounter any problems executing the instructions of this guide, you should be able to restore your CHT 3X instance using the backup data. Double check your backups are up to date. Ensure no changes happen to your CouchDB data in your CHT 3.x server after you have begun the migration process.\nTo minimize downtime when upgrading, it’s advised to prepare the 3.x installation for the 4.x upgrade, and pre-index all views that are required by 4.x.\nThe migration tool provides a command which will download all 4.x views to your 3.x CouchDb, and initiate view indexing. is any version at or above 4.0.0:\ncd ~/couchdb-migration/ docker compose run couch-migration pre-index-views Once view indexing is finished, proceed with the next step.\nCaution\nIf this step is omitted, 4.x API will fail to respond to requests until all views are indexed. Depending on the size of the database, this could take many hours, or even days.\n3. Save existent CouchDb configuration Some CouchDb configuration values must be ported from existent CouchDb to the 4.x installation. Store them in a safe location before shutting down 3.x CouchDb. Use the migration tool to obtain these values:\ncd ~/couchdb-migration/ docker compose run couch-migration get-env a) CouchDB secret Used in encrypting all CouchDb passwords and session tokens.\nb) CouchDb server uuid Used in generating replication checkpointer documents, which track where replication progress between every client and the server, and ensure that clients don’t re-download or re-upload documents.\n4. Locate and make a copy of your CouchDb Data folder a) If running in MedicOS, CouchDB data folder can be found at /srv/storage/medic-core/couchdb/data.\nb) If running a custom installation of CouchDb, data would be typically stored at /opt/couchdb/data.\n5. Stop your 3.x CouchDb / CHT-Core installation and launch 4.x CouchDb installation Depending on your project scalability needs and technical possibilities, you must decide whether you will deploy CouchDb in a single node or in a cluster with multiple nodes. Consult this guide about clustering and horizontal scalability to make an informed decision. Note\nYou can start with single node and then change to a cluster. This involves running the migration tool again to distribute shards from the existent node to the new nodes.\nDepending on your choice, follow the instructions that match your deployment below:\nSingle node a) Download 4.x single-node CouchDb docker-compose file:\nmkdir -p ~/couchdb-single/ cd ~/couchdb-single/ curl -s -o ./docker-compose.yml https://staging.dev.medicmobile.org/_couch/builds_4/medic:medic:/docker-compose/cht-couchdb.yml a) Make a copy of the 3.x CouchDb data folder from step 4.\nb) Set the correct environment variables:\ncat \u003e ${HOME}/couchdb-single/.env \u003c\u003c EOF COUCHDB_USER= COUCHDB_PASSWORD= COUCHDB_SECRET= COUCHDB_UUID= COUCHDB_DATA= EOF c) Start 4.x CouchDb.\ncd ~/couchdb-single/ docker compose up -d d) Update couchdb-migration environment variables. Depending on your setup, it’s possible you will need to update CHT_NETWORK and COUCH_URL to match the newly started 4.x CouchDb. From this point on, the couchdb-migration container should connect to the same docker network as your CouchDb installation, in order to access APIs that are only available on protected ports. Correctly setting CHT_NETWORK is required for the next steps to succeed. To get the correct docker-network-name and docker-service-name, you can use docker network ls to list all networks and docker network inspect to get the name of the CouchDb container that exists in this network.\ncat \u003e ${HOME}/couchdb-migration/.env \u003c\u003c EOF CHT_NETWORK= COUCH_URL=http://@: EOF e) Check that couchdb-migration can connect to the CouchDb instance and that CouchDb is running. You’ll know it is working when the docker compose call exits without errors and logs CouchDb is Ready.\ncd ~/couchdb-migration/ docker compose run couch-migration check-couchdb-up f) Change metadata to match the new CouchDb node\ncd ~/couchdb-migration/ docker compose run couch-migration move-node g) Run the verify command to check whether the migration was successful.\ndocker compose run couch-migration verify If all checks pass, you should see a message Migration verification passed. It is then safe to proceed with starting CHT-Core 4.x, using the same environment variables you saved in ~/couchdb-single/.env.\nh) Remove unnecessary containers.\nMulti node a) Download 4.x clustered CouchDb docker-compose file:\nmkdir -p ~/couchdb-cluster/ cd ~/couchdb-cluster/ curl -s -o ./docker-compose.yml https://staging.dev.medicmobile.org/_couch/builds_4/medic:medic:/docker-compose/cht-couchdb-clustered.yml b) Create a data folder for every one of the CouchDb nodes. If you were going to a 3 cluster node, this would be:\nmkdir -p ~/couchdb-data/main mkdir -p ~/couchdb-data/secondary1 mkdir -p ~/couchdb-data/secondary2 c) Copy the 3.x CouchDb data folder into ~/couchdb-data/main, which will be your main CouchDb node. This main node will create your cluster and the other secondary nodes will be added to it. In main’s environment variable file, define CLUSTER_PEER_IPS. In all other secondary nodes, declare the COUCHDB_SYNC_ADMINS_NODE variable instead.\nd) Create a shards and a .shards directory in every secondary node folder.\ne) Set the correct environment variables:\ncat \u003e ${HOME}/couchdb-cluster/.env \u003c\u003c EOF COUCHDB_USER= COUCHDB_PASSWORD= COUCHDB_SECRET= COUCHDB_UUID= DB1_DATA= DB2_DATA= DB3_DATA= EOF f) Start 4.x CouchDb.\ncd ~/couchdb-cluster/ docker compose up -d g) Update couchdb-migration environment variables. Depending on your setup, it’s possible you will need to update CHT_NETWORK and COUCH_URL to match the newly started 4.x CouchDb. From this point on, the couchdb-migration container should connect to the same docker network as your CouchDb installation, in order to access APIs that are only available on protected ports. Correctly setting CHT_NETWORK is required for the next steps to succeed.

You’ll know it is working when the docker compose call exits without errors and logs CouchDb Cluster is Ready.\ncd ~/couchdb-migration/ docker compose run couch-migration check-couchdb-up i) Generate the shard distribution matrix and get instructions for final shard locations.\ncd ~/couchdb-migration/ shard_matrix=$(docker compose run couch-migration generate-shard-distribution-matrix) docker compose run couch-migration shard-move-instructions $shard_matrix j) Follow the instructions from the step above and move the shard files to the correct location, according to the shard distribution matrix. This is a manual step that requires to physically move data around on disk.\nExample of moving one shard from one node to another:\n/couchdb_data_main /.delete /_dbs.couch /_nodes.couch /_users.couch /.shards /00000000-15555554 /2aaaaaaa-3ffffffe /3fffffff-55555553 /6aaaaaa9-7ffffffd /7ffffffe-95555552 /15555555-2aaaaaa9 /55555554-6aaaaaa8 /95555553-aaaaaaa7 /shards /00000000-15555554 /2aaaaaaa-3ffffffe /3fffffff-55555553 /6aaaaaa9-7ffffffd /7ffffffe-95555552 /15555555-2aaaaaa9 /55555554-6aaaaaa8 /95555553-aaaaaaa7 /couchdb_data_secondary /.shards /shards After moving two shards: 55555554-6aaaaaa8 and 6aaaaaa9-7ffffffd\n/couchdb_data_main /.delete /_dbs.couch /_nodes.couch /_users.couch /.shards /00000000-15555554 /2aaaaaaa-3ffffffe /3fffffff-55555553 /7ffffffe-95555552 /15555555-2aaaaaa9 /95555553-aaaaaaa7 /shards /00000000-15555554 /2aaaaaaa-3ffffffe /3fffffff-55555553 /7ffffffe-95555552 /15555555-2aaaaaa9 /95555553-aaaaaaa7 /couchdb_data_secondary /.shards /6aaaaaa9-7ffffffd /55555554-6aaaaaa8 /shards /6aaaaaa9-7ffffffd /55555554-6aaaaaa8 k) Change metadata to match the new shard distribution. We declared $shard_matrix in step “g” above, so it is still set now:\ndocker compose run couch-migration move-shards $shard_matrix l) Remove old node from the cluster:\ndocker compose run couch-migration remove-node couchdb@127.0.0.1 j) Run the verify command to check whether the migration was successful.\ndocker compose run couch-migration verify If all checks pass, you should see a message Migration verification passed. It is then safe to proceed with starting CHT-Core 4.x, using the same environment variables you saved in ~/couchdb-cluster/.env.\nk) Remove unnecessary containers.\n6. Cleanup It’s very important to remove temporary containers that were used during migration and containers that deployed the previous CHT-Core 3.x installation. Only follow this step after making sure your CHT-Core 4.x installation is ready and can be used.\nWarning\nEven if these containers are stopped, depending on their configuration, they could restart when the Docker engine is restarted, for example on system reboot.","1-install-cht-data-migration-tool#1.

See the details below regarding the new add-date function for a cleaner way of calculating dates based on an offset. The behavior of the today function has changed to return the current date at midnight in the current timezone instead of at the current time. To get the current date and current time use the now function. decimal-date-time: The behavior of this function has changed with regard to the default timezone used when calculating the decimal value of a date that does not include any timezone information. (Note that the values from basic date questions do NOT include time zone information.) Previously, the timezone used in the calculation for dates with no timezone information was UTC. Now, the user’s current timezone will be used. Practically speaking, this means it is no longer safe to assume that the output from decimal-date-time, for a value from a basic date question, will be a whole number. Now it is likely that a decimal value will be returned (with the numbers after the decimal point representing the offset of the user’s timezone from UTC). Previously this function would accept various string parameters (e.g. date strings with various formats) as input. Now, the only string values it will only accept are ones formatted according to ISO 8601 (e.g. 2022-10-03).

For data synchronization, refer to CHT Sync.","assumptions--prerequisites#Assumptions \u0026amp; Prerequisites":"This guide assumes:\nYour CHT instance set up. Your Postgres server is set up. We’ll be using 10.195.130.93 in this documentation, but be sure to use your production Postgres address. The server needs to have pg_dump command available. Your CHT couch2pg (aka couch2pg) instance is set up. In this guide, we’ll assume it’s on the same server as the Postgres instance. You want to move both couch2pg instance and the Postgres data to a new server Further, be sure you meet the following prerequisites:\nHave provisioned a new Postgres server. The server needs to have pg_restore command available. Have access to existing Postgres server to be able to dump the data Have access to couch2pg instance, including the CHT Core credentials it’s using Have 3x the disk space as your data on both the old and new server - see below Note: If you don’t mind waiting and don’t want to deal with the trouble of copying large data files around as documented on this page, it will be easier to set up a clean install of couch2pg","cleanup#Cleanup":"When you’re 100% sure the migration was successful - don’t rush this part! - be sure to clean up file, servers and services that may still be running:\nDelete any *.tar and *.tar.gz files on the old Postgres server, on your computer and on the new Postgres server Stop couch2pg running on the old service If the data is truly not needed, drop the cht database on the old Postgres server Delete any backups of the old server and service","current-postgres-data-and-couch2pg-config#Current Postgres data and couch2pg config":"SSH to your postgres server Connect to the cht database and run this query: select count(*) from couchdb; We’ll use this in the next server to validate data was imported. On large datasets this may take a long while to run. Create a tarball of your database. This assumes you’re using the default cht name for your database with a username of couch2pg. Replace with your database and username if they’re different: pg_dump -U couch2pg -d cht -F tar -f couch2pg.tar gzip couch2pg.tar Note - If you get errors like query failed: ERROR: permission denied - run this command as the postgres user. Check the size of the gzip - we’ll use this in the next section: ls -al couch2pg.tar.gz Copy the resulting couch2pg.tar.gz file to your computer - scp is good for this! Check the values for all the environment variables for couch2pg. For example, here’s what our current couch2pg has for it’s config. In our case the POSTGRESQL_URL is localhost because we’re on the same server as the Postgres server. Be sure to use POSTGRESQL_URL and COUCHDB_URL that match your deployment: POSTGRESQL_URL=postgres://couch2pg:passwordHere1@localhost:5432/cht COUCHDB_URL=https://medic:passwordHere2@192-168-68-23.local-ip.medicmobile.org:10443/medic COUCH2PG_SLEEP_MINS=360 COUCH2PG_DOC_LIMIT=100 COUCH2PG_CHANGES_LIMIT=5000 COUCH2PG_RETRY_COUNT=5 COUCH2PG_USERS_META_DOC_LIMIT=50","dashboards#Dashboards":"Check the logs of couch2pg. Be sure there’s no errors and that materialized views are updating as expected. Complex materialized views can take hours to update. Don’t hesitate to let multiple periods of COUCH2PG_SLEEP_MINS (how frequently couch2pg runs) pass to ensure no errors occur.\nDouble check data is synchronizing by running a SQL query one of your dashboards uses. Make sure the data is both accurate and up to date. When you are confident the data is valid and working correctly, change any downstream sources, like Superset or Klipfolio, to use the new Postgres server IP and credentials\nIf at a later date you find there’s substantial errors, you can always change your downstream sources back to using the old Postgres server and attempt the migration again, fixing errors where needed.","disk-space-prerequisites#Disk space prerequisites":"You need 3 times the database size of free disk space on both the old and new Postgres servers. The 3x number comes from 3 sources of data:\nExisting Postgres database Dump of this same data via pg_dump making a compressed copy with gzip While you may not fully need all of 3x the disk space, having the extra space will be important to ensure you don’t accidentally fill up the disk on a production instance.\nFor example, on a Postgres server with 400GB disk with millions of documents in Postgres:\n175GB - Existing Postgres database 175GB - Dump of this same data via pg_dump ~60GB - making a compressed copy with gzip The server is healthy woth just over 40% of the disk used day to day. However, if you make a copy of the data (175GB + 175GB = 350GB), you now have the disk over 85% full with only 50GB free. You very likely will not have room to compress the data (175GB + 175GB + 60GB = 410GB).\nThe best work around is to increase the size of your Postgres server assuming you’re on a cloud provider that offers this. Another work around can be to run pg_dump from another computer with more disk space, but note that this will send the uncompressed data over the network which may take a long time. The same is true doing the restore over the network - it will be much slower than if you did it locally.\nTo show disk use of all databases, run this command, being sure to replace couch2pg with your user:\npsql -U couch2pg -c '\\l+'","instructions#Instructions":"","new-postgres-server-and-couch2pg-instance#New Postgres server and couch2pg instance":"Copy the couch2pg.tar.gz file to the new Postgres server SSH to the new Postgres server Make sure the gzip’s bytes on disk exactly match the one from step 4 in the prior section: ls -al couch2pg.tar.gz Uncompress the file: gunzip couch2pg.tar.gz Ensure your have a cht database already created on your new Postgres instance: CREATE DATABASE cht; Stop couch2pg if it is running Load the data from the dump file, again be sure to use the current user if couch2pg is the same for you: pg_restore -U couch2pg -d cht couch2pg.tar Connect to the cht database and run this query: select count(*) from couchdb; This should match the same number as on step 2 above. On large datasets this may take a long while to run. Start couch2pg, being sure to use the exact same environment variables as step 6 above, but possibly with different POSTGRES_* values if they’ve changed for the new Postgres server Check the logs of couch2pg and ensure there’s no errors.","time-to-copy#Time to copy":"Copying and loading large amounts of Postgres data can take a long time. If you make a mistake, going back to the first step can take more time. Don’t plan a production migration without doing at least one dry run! Do more dry runs until your confident that everything works as expected.\nConsider keeping your old couch2pg system running alongside your new one. This will allow you to fail over to the old one easily and it will be up to date with data from your CHT instance. It is safe to run multiple couch2pg instances against the same CHT instance.\nWhen you’re confident the new system is up and running, is stable and performant, go ahead and decommission the old system."},"title":"Migration"},"/hosting/couch2pg/setup-and-devlopment/":{"data":{"":"CHT couch2pg is deprecated.

For example mrjones-dev namespace - likely the same as project name, your user followed by -dev. For example mrjones-dev chtversion - this should match the version you cloned from password - this should match the version you cloned from secret - this should match the version you cloned from user - use medic user uuid - this should match the version you cloned from couchdb_node_storage_size - use the same size as the volume you just cloned account-id - this should always be 720541322708 host - this should be your username followed by dev.medicmobile.org. For example mrjones.dev.medicmobile.org hosted_zone_id - this should always be Z3304WUAJTCM7P preExistingDataAvailable - set this to be true dataPathOnDiskForCouchDB - use the subPath you got in the step above. For example storage/medic-core/couchdb/data preExistingEBSVolumeID-1 - set this to be the ID from step 2. For example vol-f9dsa0f9sad09f0dsa preExistingEBSVolumeSize - use the same size as the volume you just cloned Deploy this to development per the steps above.

This feature is only compatible with cht-android version v1.5.2 or greater. Single Sign-On (SSO) feature allows deployments to use the industry standard OpenID Connect (OIDC) protocol to authenticate users. Below are some key points on the SSO functionality in the CHT. See the technical design document for more details.","cht-user-session#CHT User Session":"Once an SSO user has successfully authenticated with the CHT (by completing the OIDC flow), their browser receives a valid Couch session cookie (equivalent to the session cookies provided to normal CHT users). For all subsequent operations, the CHT does not distinguish between SSO and non-SSO users since both types of users are authenticating with the same type of session cookie.\nIt is very important to note that once an SSO user has successfully authenticated with the CHT, the CHT does not contact the OIDC Provider for subsequent requests from that user. If the user is removed from the OIDC Provider (or their OIDC session is otherwise invalidated), they will still be able to access the CHT. This is because their CHT session cookie is still valid. You can prevent the user from accessing the CHT by disabling their CHT user account, updating their “SSO Email Address” or removing it and setting a new password for the user.","limitations#Limitations":"While completely compliant with the OIDC specification, the SSO functionality in the CHT currently has several notable limitations (any of which may be addressed in future releases):\nUser auto-provisioning is not supported. Users must be created in the CHT before they can log in with SSO. The CHT does not automatically create users when they log in with SSO for the first time. Back-channel logout is not supported. As noted above, when a user’s OIDC session is ended, it does not automatically end their CHT session. User mapping between OIDC and CHT users only supports matching on the email claim from the OIDC user. The CHT does not support mapping on other claims (e.g. sub or preferred_username).","oidc-login-sequence#OIDC Login Sequence":"The following diagram demonstrates the sequence of events when a user logs in to the CHT using SSO:\nsequenceDiagram autonumber participant cht as CHT (api server) participant user_agent as User (web browser) participant auth_server as OIDC Provider (authorization server) user_agent-\u003e\u003echt: Request SSO login authorization cht-\u003e\u003euser_agent: Redirect to authorize endpoint on OIDC provider user_agent-\u003e\u003eauth_server: Request OIDC authorization (happens automatically) auth_server-\u003e\u003euser_agent: Respond with authentication challenge (e.g. login page) user_agent-\u003e\u003eauth_server: User authenticates (e.g. submits SSO username/password) auth_server--\u003e\u003eauth_server: Authenticate user auth_server-\u003e\u003euser_agent: Redirect back to CHT (with authorization_code) user_agent-\u003e\u003echt: Submit authorization_code (happens automatically) cht--\u003e\u003eauth_server: Request id_token with email scope auth_server--\u003e\u003eauth_server: Validates authorization_code and client credentials auth_server--\u003e\u003echt: Reply with id_token (including email claim) cht-\u003e\u003euser_agent: Reply with session cookie Note over cht,user_agent: Subsequent requests are made with the session cookie and do not require contactingthe OIDC provider","setup#Setup":"Follow the setup steps to configure your CHT instance for SSO Login.

The “SSO Email Address” field will be also be visible in the create/update users modal in the App Management interface.","user-mapping#User Mapping":"Note that the “SSO Email Address” field is used to populate the user’s oidc_username property. The oidc_username is stored separately from the user’s normal email property (populated from the “Email Address” field in the App Management interface) and different values can be provided for each. Only the oidc_username will be considered when logging in an SSO user. Users with the can_edit_profile permission are able to edit their email value, but only administrators can edit a user’s oidc_username.\nIf someone selects the “Login with SSO” button and successfully authenticates with the OIDC provider, but their OIDC user account does not have a corresponding CHT user (the email claim from the OIDC user does not match any CHT user oidc_username), they will not be logged into the CHT. Instead they will be redirected back to the login page with an error message indicating that they are not allowed to log in with SSO.\nUsers with a currently active OIDC session may not be required to re-authenticate. Instead, when logging into the CHT for the first time they will be prompted by their OIDC Provider to allow the CHT to access their user information.\nA user with the oidc_username property is only allowed to log in with SSO. Any other authentication method (e.g. username/password or token login) will fail.\nTo convert an SSO user in the CHT back to a normal CHT user (with username/password authentication), simply remove the user’s oidc_username (by deleting the value from the “SSO Email Address” field). A new password must then be set for the user.

Since targets rely on the data on the device, if targets include data from other users then permissions must be set on the relevant forms so that the data can be replicated and synchronized accordingly. API Calls: Given that all form submissions are captured in JSON and that we know the data model well, you can easily do API calls to a CHT server instance and use some custom code (node, python etc) to gather and show stats on a daily basis. You can export to either JSON or CSV. See API docs for reports as well as monitoring metadata. PostgreSQL queries: CHT ships with a utility to export all the data that the API has to a relational database, Postgres. You have all the raw data the API has, but can now use the power of joins and groupings to come up with totally customizable stats by day, week, month etc. Data can be synched near real time from the CHT. Dashboards: Medic has used both Klipfolio and, more recently, Superset to create more complex yet still user-friendly dashboards. This is particular useful for those who need to view the data but wouldn’t otherwise be logging in to CHT apps. These dashboards generally access the relational data in the Postgres database as the back end.

This document describes the hybrid 2wT system features and its functionalities. It also provides an opportunity for digital health implementers to explore and learn how direct-to-client communication can be achieved through integrating app features within the CHT, with messaging technologies such as RapidPro and SMS aggregators.\nProblem being addressed Recipients of health care in sub-Saharan Africa face significant barriers in accessing quality services. These barriers include geographical distance, limited availability of skilled health care workers, and both direct and indirect costs - all of which can present major challenges in clients getting timely access to health care. It is important to bring healthcare services closer to client’s households, especially those who live in remote areas. The D2C / 2wT workflows assist in addressing the health needs of such clients through connecting clients with health care providers based at the facility or community, including both clinicians or lower-level healthcare workers. Unlike phone calls which must be answered, D2C / 2wT offers convenient care – allowing both parties to communicate when needed or wanted. Unlike interventions that require a smartphone or downloading an app, 2wT clients communicate directly via the SMS capability in even basic mobile phones. D2C / 2wT can help improve healthcare access, encourage client engagement in care, promote healthy behaviors and support delivery of client centered care, including in harder to reach rural or remote areas.\nSolution overview The CHT offers general guidance on how SMS workflows can be built on CHT. CHT SMS based workflows can be configured to support D2C / 2wT between health care providers and clients. The D2C / 2wT workflows can be designed to support:\nRegular client check-ins to help keep track of the client’s condition Sending of client follow up appointment reminders with confirmation requests Sharing of information and educational health messages with the clients Client tracing and client review tasks can be assigned to specific healthcare workers. Escalated workflows can result in tasks in CHT apps for CHWs, clerks or nurses, depending on need Two-way conversation messaging between healthcare providers and clients 2wT-based telehealth, providing a lower cost format for clinical triaging, reassurance or referral to in-person care via SMS Furthermore, CHT allows integration with other health information systems including District Health Information Software 2 (DHIS2) and facility-based electronic medical record systems such as OpenMRS.\nCHT SMS workflow technical overview The SMS workflows in CHT can integrate with RapidPro flows to support two way interactive messaging between healthcare providers and household members. RapidPro is an open source tool that has the capability to support conversational messaging flows via SMS, Interactive Voice Response (IVR), Telegram, Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp. With the CHT-RapidPro integration, it is possible to design and configure SMS workflows in the two systems. Data is shared between CHT and Rapidpro via the APIs; and the information from the interactive texting is used to update clients details on CHT through CouchDB which can trigger tasks on CHT.\nCHT-RapidPro SMS workflows allows for automated visit scheduling, replying and routing to an SMS based gateway based on preconfigured SMS logic, thus eliminating the need for a healthcare worker (clerk or clinician, depending on the intervention specifics) to send, monitor and reply to each text. To use SMS workflows with CHT, you will need a texting channel (a service that enables you to send or receive messages or a phone call). CHT can be integrated with a texting channel like an SMS aggregator which provides a reliable cloud based platform to send and receive an unlimited number of SMSs to and from clients or household members.\nDirect-to-client, two-way texting, technical architecture The CHT-RapidPro integration enables App builders to build complex conversational SMS workflows that support client care and support coordination of care at the facility and community levels.\nClients are enrolled directly using the CHT D2C, 2wT app using a phone, tablet or computer. Clients need only simple phones and do not need to download an app. The resulting client data is then stored and managed using CouchDB and a PostgreSQL database system. Through the CHT application programming interface (API), client messages are sent to Rapidpro, and RapidPro pushes summary data back to the CHT to update client responses and status. On the client interface these can be automated messages or interactive free text with healthcare providers. An SMS text message aggregator service and a short code channel linked to RapidPro streamlines the incoming and outgoing SMS text messages; while the CHT generates the appropriate tasks (help clinicians triage, refer, track, and trace clients)and reports (keep track of completed actions and monitor clients) as represented in figure 1.\nFigure 1: System architecture of direct-to-client (D2C), two-way texting (2wT) for voluntary medical male circumcision (VMMC) postoperative care. API: application programming interface; CHT: Community Health Toolkit.\nThe CHT core framework has inbuilt privacy/security features including two- factor authentication, role based authorization, data security, and a range of protected data access endpoints. The system can be configured to manage user roles and permissions for access of CHT applications. Responsible data practices is enforced through the Privacy and Data Protection Policy.\nThe D2C, 2wT app incorporates the CHT security features in order to protect client data and ensure the confidentiality and privacy of client information. Users are encouraged to use password protected user accounts, the app also has full disk encryption and auto-lock screens for users’ devices (android phones and tablets) in order to minimize the risk of unwarranted access. Role based access controls also make sure that users can only view and edit information that the permissions assigned to the user role allow them to.\nCase adaptation: Voluntary medical male circumcision app co-designed by I-TECH and Medic The University of Washington, Department of Global Health’s International Training and Education Center for Health (I-TECH), Medic, and local partners including Zim-TTECH, Lighthouse Trust, and Aurum Institute, collaboratively designed, developed, and scaled a CHT-based voluntary medical male circumcision (VMMC) app for post-operative follow-up with support from the National Institute of Health, USA The D2C, 2wT app supports automated, interactive telehealth via direct-to-client messaging between VMMC nurses and clients. 2wT telehealth helps improve the quality and efficiency of care, maintaining client safety while lowering follow-up care costs. In the spirit of contributing to the growth of the public global goods, I-TECH and Medic have coordinated to release the application source code of the D2C, 2wT app.\nUsers and hierarchy Users Location Devices Roles Program managers / M\u0026E Admin level Laptop Users at this level have access to all sites. They can access many sites via the CHT D2C messaging App. They can download information from the dashboard. Hub / Super nurse Admin level Laptop / Desktop Users have access to multiple sites within the district and can access them via the CHT D2C messaging App. They are online users and are able to triage, refer clients to health facilities to be reviewed by site nurses. Site nurse Health facility or outreach site Smartphone Users are routine MC nurses at health facilities or outreach sites who enroll D2C clients and interact with clients enrolled at their site via the CHT D2C messaging app. In higher volume facilities, data clerks may also be involved in data entry of client enrolment details. VMMC Clients Community / household level Smartphone / feature phone VMMC clients with access to mobile devices and who have consented to participate in and have been enrolled into the D2C, 2wT app. They will receive daily check in messages and can communicate with their health care providers via text. Workflows Current workflow for voluntary medical male circumcision client enrollment, screening and procedures, before direct-to-client messaging was introduced:\n1. Enrolment - Static/Outreach Site visit 2. HIV Testing, screening \u0026 counseling 3. Procedure 4. Static/Outreach Site visit 5. Follow up visit Nurse enrols clients Client tested for HIV, screened for wounds, any form of bleeding, and any other medical issues. Counselling provided as needed. If client’s HIV status doesn’t pose risks, procedure is done. Post-operative counseling offered Register after surgery On Day 2 and Day 7 after surgery 1. Automated check-in workflow to support client care Eligible male clients with access to mobile phones are registered on the VMMC app to enable them to receive daily check-in texts to help track the condition of the clients for 13 days after the circumcision. During registration (Day 0), details about the method of circumcision; whether the client is an adult or a minor, and the preferred phone numbers to be used for communication are recorded. Each client receives an enrollment confirmation to ensure that the communication channel is open. Clients also receive postoperative counseling using the 2wT flip-book on how to respond to the daily SMS text message and review photos that illustrate the signs of complications for reporting via daily SMS text messages. VMMC clients, including those with 2wT, have the option to attend routine pre-scheduled visits on day 2 and day 7 post-op.\nAfter the registration, the VMMC clients registered on the VMMC app receive preconfigured, bidirectional daily follow up texts to check on their healing. These are in the form of automated daily SMS text messages on days 1 to 13 in the predominant languages of the area. The clients respond to the daily SMS text message with a single numeric (0=no problem or 1=I need help) response. They could respond to any daily SMS text message at any time. They could also initiate an unrestricted, freely-worded text response at any time, and in any language - instead of or in addition to the daily numeric response.\nAn adverse event (AE) is any complication or problem that may happen during or after a surgery, including a VMMC surgery. AEs may be mild, moderate or severe. All moderate and severe AEs should be reviewed by a clinician. Moderate and severe AEs after VMMC are rare, but occur about 2% of the time. . Identifying AEs swiftly and managing them properly is a sign of a quality surgical program, including VMMC programs.\nDirect to client messaging for voluntary male circumcision clients without AE:\nEnrolment Automated, daily check-in SMS {{No Action}} 1a Static/Outreach Site visit Data Clerk/Site Nurse enrolls eligible clients into the D2C program using the enrollment form 2 System sends automated daily SMS to client to see how they are doing. 3 SMS response AE absent 1b Registration and SMS confirmation Client gets a confirmation of enrollment Via SMS 2a Client SMS response with potential AE present Continue automated daily check-in SMS until day 13 2b Client SMS response AE absent 2. Triaging to care workflow for clients with potential complications Clients with potential AEs (those who respond with 1 or a free text indicating concerns) are followed up by nurses and given care via the D2C, 2wT intervention. Clients may be followed up via SMS / call. Nurses provide education and reassurance, or refer in cases where they need to go to a health facility for in-person review if an emergency was suspected. The clients could request a call back to speak with the nurse during routine clinic hours; the nurse could also initiate calls to follow up with clients when desired.\nDirect-to-client messaging for voluntary male circumcision clients without AEs:\nEnrolment Automated, daily check-in SMS Referral for care task Client review visit 1a Static/Outreach Site visit.

Escalated workflow to generate tasks when clients do not respond If the client has not responded to any of the daily check in-messages by day 3, they get a reminder message to check on them and prompt a response. A tracing follow up task is triggered for the 2WT nurse if a VMMC client does not respond to any of the daily check in texts by day 4 for both minors and adults. The 2WT nurse then records the tracing method and outcomes by completing the trace client task.\nA VMMC client who responds with a potential complication triggers a Client review: Potential complication task for the 2WT nurse. They then report and fill in whether the client was reviewed by a clinician. If the client has been reviewed by a clinician, they record the details of the review, time, place and adverse events identified. If the client has not been reviewed by a clinician, the 2WT nurse will try and trace them by SMS, phone call or a home visit; and report the tracing outcomes as shown in figure 6 below.\nDirect-to-client messaging for voluntary male circumcision clients without adverse effects:\nEnrolment Automated, daily check-in SMS Tracing follow up task Client review visit 1a Static/Outreach Site visit Data Clerk/Site Nurse enrols eligible VMMC clients into the D2C, 2wT program using the enrolment form 2 Check in SMS of Wellbeing System sends automated daily SMS to client to see how they are doing. 3a No client response by day 3= additional check-in SMS at noon 4 When the client comes to the health facility after a referral, the clinicians (nurses or clinical associates) at site level use the Client in-person visit form to complete the details of the review 1b Registration and SMS confirmation Client gets a confirmation of enrollment Via SMS 2a Client SMS response with potential AE present 3b No client response by day 4.

If nurse thinks client may have AE referral for care task is cleared by completing the Referral for Care form, calling site nurse to alert of referral, and the client is informed via call or message 4. Clients can share requests by messaging health care providers. Clients registered in the intervention can also initiate the bidirectional messaging with a 2WT Nurse by messaging a central phone number or a short code. Clients can report any concern, ask a question about wound healing, or request for help from health care providers via SMS. For this workflow, the logic can be preconfigured to support health triage and clinical referrals. Using the messaging functionality on CHT, health care providers based at the facility can view, manage and respond to incoming texts from VMMC clients.\nEvidence of Impact In collaboration with researchers at the University of Washington, we assessed the effectiveness of the 2wT intervention through randomized controlled trials in Zimbabwe and South Africa. The foundational randomized control trial in Zimbabwe in 2018, demonstrated that post-surgical client follow up via SMS was as safe as follow up care at the clinic, and that the transition to SMS-based follow-up option enabled an 85% reduction in unnecessary clinic visits. Similar findings were reported in South Africa. This approach to messaging with clients was more efficient and cheaper than standard care, thereby lowering costs. Both clients and clinicians both found the approach to be highly usable and acceptable for post-operative care and further usability studies found that it was preferred by clients and providers alike (see “Benefits” below). We are also expanding our application of D2C, 2wT for antiretroviral therapy (ART) clients in Malawi, aiming to have similarly positive impact on engagement in ART and retention in HIV care.\nBenefits For Clients Reduced cost of follow-up Comfort and ease of usability of 2WT Real-time clinical support in your pocket Rapid support in case of suspected AE Of Participation Increase demand/interest from men who would opt for MMC but not for the follow-up visits Early identification of AE’s Ability to scale based on organizational needs Less clinical time spend on unnecessary followup-visits Publications Great focus/time on incoming clients for MMC More scenarios where direct-to-client messaging can be used to support client care 1. Facility appointment reminders workflow Appointment reminders can be configured on CHT so that household members and clients can receive facility appointment reminders. Facility appointment reminders are configured as per the recommended health guidelines for specific use cases. The clinic visit appointment reminders can be configured to automatically stop once a client completes the expected clinic visits.\n2. Active case finding by messaging household members with survey questions Active case finding by messaging households with survey questions about the health of family members.\nFrequently Asked Questions Is the client charged for receiving or sending the SMS? It is possible for health programs to acquire a zero rated short code service which is free for clients and household members to send and receive texts from the short code. What are ways to handle exceptions? Exceptions can occur when programs and flows do not work as expected. This may occur due to various technical issues and may be unavoidable. One possible way to handle these unwanted issues and errors is to set up the mail group such that a notification email is sent whenever there is any exception. Another method is to keep track of whether the flow was completed i.e., all the responses from start to finish nodes were received. For the participants whose flow may have been interrupted or incomplete, one may run the workflow again. Ways to improve response rate from clients? The workflows in RapidPro can be set up in such a way that they expire after a certain time period. Workflows can expire when there is no response from a client within a time period. You can handle such situations by repeating the workflow i.e., sending them again to the client after a certain time interval. Alternatively, it can be beneficial to do some research on which time to send the message. For example, a person may be busy at work and/or away from the phone during working hours. It may be easier for them to respond during early morning or later in the evening than in the afternoon.

The public report form captures information about the adverse effects and medication including side effects, onset date, and current status of the reaction. Additionally, the form captures medication details such as name of the medicine, manufacturer, purchase location, start date, stop date, and expiry date. In case of a variety of medicines, the form allows a CHA to perform multiple entries.\nThe CHA also uses the public report to record outcome details, including outcome specification and recovery status. Using the public report form, the CHA is able to refer household members to the nearest facility for further review and care, this action generates a referral follow up task for the CHP. The referral follow up task appears 7 days after facility referral and guides the CHP to follow up referred cases to confirm if patients attended the referral . The CHP can also check the condition of patients and once they complete the referral follow up task, the CHA gets patient status notification task.","resources-to-get-started#Resources to Get Started":"Here are a few additional resources to help get you started with the pharmacovigilance health reference application.\nView the configuration code for this reference app Install the reference app following these easy installation instructions Modify the pharmacovigilance reference application for your project context using configuration best practices The open sharing of digital health apps used by CHWs is a monumental milestone in the digital health space, and for the CHT Community.

This is now fixed.\n[#4085]","death-reporting#Death Reporting":"More than a feature, we’re now supporting death reporting workflows which allow a user to report a death, another user to confirm that death, and all users to see which family members are deceased on both person and household profiles. Also includes the ever-popular “resurrection” feature which allows us to undo a death.\nOur app now supports an expanded workflow for death reporting. The sketch below outlines the basic death reporting workflow that can be done on SMS or in our app, or with a combination of both app and SMS. Some health systems may not require a confirmation of the death by someone other than the CHW, or the person doing the confirmations may not be a user of our tools. In that case, the workflow can be simplified to just step one, where the CHW reports the death.\nStep one (death report) can be submitted by the CHW via SMS or the mobile app. Once the death report is submitted, the manager or nurse can get an SMS notification or a task to follow up with the community to confirm the death (until the supervisor app is built, the manager/nurse would need access to patient reports in order to get this task). The manager or nurse would then confirm the death and submit a death confirmation report. Once the death is confirmed, the person is marked as deceased in the app.\nThere are a few things that can happen when someone is marked as deceased. First, the app can update a person’s profile to make it clear the person is deceased. It can also automatically update the family (or CHW area for SMS projects) profile to separate any deceased people from other people in the family or area. Finally, any deceased people will appear at the bottom of search results. Tech leads: make sure you also configure all tasks so that they are cleared when a person is confirmed to be deceased. The app will add a date_of_death field to the person’s doc once the death is confirmed.\nWhat happens if a death is confirmed but it turns out to have been done in error? We also support a workflow for undoing a death. A CHW can request a correction and if the nurse or manager agrees that a correction is needed, she can undo the death. This reverses all of the profile changes noted above.\nTo configure a death reporting workflow, you will need:\nDeath report form Death confirmation form Request correction form Undo death form Task or SMS notification for nurse or manager to confirm the death Task or SMS notification for nurse or manager to undo the death New configuration for all person-level tasks so that they clear as soon as the death confirmation form is submitted if that form indicates the person is actually deceased Enable the death_reporting Sentinel transition A death_reporting property in app_settings so that you can indicate which form should confirm deaths and which form should undo deaths Here’s an example of what you would add to app_settings to get the profile updates to work:\n\"transitions\": { \"death_reporting\": true }, \"death_reporting\": { \"mark_deceased_forms\": [ \"death_confirmation\" ], \"undo_deceased_forms\": [ \"undo_death\" ] } The Sentinel transition simply adds a date of death of the person to their profile doc. Currently, it will be the reported_date of the death confirmation form. This is not currently customizable, but you can choose to display the date the CHW entered as the date of death on the person’s profile. We are planning to improve this in 2.16.0 by allowing you to use a date_of_death field in your death confirmation form as the date that is transferred to the person’s doc. If you want to record dates of death for people but not have the profiles update, just use the transition and don’t add the death_reporting property to app_settings.\n[#3956]","export-to-csv#Export to CSV":"Ever use our export to XML feature? Nope? We didn’t either. Now you can export to CSV for all of your data analysis needs. Get your pivot table on!\nStarting in 2.15.0, you can now export data directly from the Medic webapp in CSV format. You can choose to export all records or you may use the filters on the reports page to export a subset of reports. Whatever is appearing when you click Export is what will download, so if some filters have been applied before clicking Export, then your CSV will only include the reports that fit your filter criteria. Every export will include all forms and all fields, so if you download more than one type of form, you may find that you have a lot of columns, but this is just to ensure that we have a column for each field in each form since forms have different field names. Only admins can export because exporting returns all reports so it’s only available to users who are allowed to access all data. \\\nNote that after you click Export, it may take 10 seconds or so before the Export starts downloading, so be patient! [#3594]","filter-bar-place-filter-highlighted#Filter bar, place filter highlighted":"image\nHowever, as we started using version 2 with our SMS projects, we needed the ability to filter by CHW area. In those projects, CHW areas are the 'clinic' level places. In order to avoid further performance issues for projects that register families, we made this a configurable option.\nimage\nThe default is to show only the district_hospital and health_center levels in the places filter. If you only want to see those two levels, there is no need to change your config. However, if you want to see the clinic places as well, you will need to add the following anywhere in your app_settings.json file:\n\"place_hierarchy_types\": [\"district_hospital\", \"health_center\", \"clinic\"], DO NOT display clinic places if your project is registering families as this will cause performance issues with admin or program manager (full access) users rendering the reports page.\n[#3902]","fine-grained-time-on-reports-list#Fine-Grained Time on Reports List":"At 15:02 on June 6th, we made it possible for you to see the exact time your reports came in.\nStarting in 2.15.0, reports received today show the exact time. This makes it easier to see how many reports have come in today at a glance. This way you can see if the gateway is working properly. Once you get to the next day, reports will use relative times and dates as they had prior to this change.\n[#3613]","improved-nurse-enabled-workflows-on-sms#Improved Nurse-Enabled Workflows on SMS":"Nurses are busy and can’t always sit down in front of the webapp. We’re now able to notify a CHW of when a nurse submits a patient report via SMS.\nThis feature is an enhancement for SMS workflows where nurses are confirming visits or deliveries using Textforms or Collect. We’ve made it possible for the CHW to receive an SMS notification when a nurse confirms a visit or delivery via SMS. The diagram below describes how the messages would flow.\nTo help make configuration easier, we have some new aliases available (mentioned earlier in this doc). The new aliases are clinic, health_center, and district and they are calculated off of the patient. The clinic is the CHW area, so the message goes to the CHW; health_center is the facility level, so the message goes to the primary contact of the health facility; and district is the district hospital level, so the message goes to the primary contact of the district hospital.\nIf your project has both the CHW and the nurse confirming visits, you’ll want to send only an auto-reply when the CHW reports a visit but you’ll want to send both an auto-reply and a notification when the nurse reports a visit so that the nurse knows the visit report was received and the CHW knows the patient went to the facility. You can use a bool_expr on the CHW notification so that it only goes out when it’s a nurse sending in the visit confirmation.\n[#3412]","just-in-time-messages#Just-in-Time Messages":"Just-in-time messages are available just in time for you to get those messages to that CHW who changed her phone number last week. And if she got any messages in the wrong language, we’ve got you covered.\nPreviously, the phone number and outgoing message language were set at the time that a schedule was created. If a CHW changed her phone number, only new registrations would go to the new phone number. Any schedules that were ongoing would still send messages to her old phone number.\nWith this new feature, any updates to phone numbers are reflected in real time for any scheduled messages that are not yet pending or sent. In addition, if there are messages in your schedule going to the nurse or a CHW supervisor and they have to change their phone number, any messages in existing schedules that are going to be sent to them in the future will go to the new numbers.\nAfter updating Elizabeth’s phone number, you’ll see the following. Note that the auto-reply will have been sent to her old phone number because it was sent immediately after registration. If you look at the outgoing messages, you’ll see that all have been updated to use Elizabeth’s new number.\nThis improvement also affects outgoing message language. If the outgoing message language is changed, all future messages, including those in ongoing schedules, will be sent in the new language. So if a CHW registers a pregnancy and the outgoing messages are generated in English initially, if the project changes the outgoing language to Swahili, any remaining messages will be sent out in Swahili.\nThese changes will occur as soon as you reload the report(s) affected by the update. You should see the new phone number appear as the recipient of any future scheduled messages. The future scheduled messages should also be in the new language for outgoing messages, if you’ve updated that.\nIn order for this feature to work for both phone number and translation updates, you must make sure your config:\nUses only translation keys for ALL outgoing messages, including scheduled messages, auto-replies, and notifications. You must remove ALL message arrays and replace with translation keys. Uses the correct alias for each message recipient for all scheduled messages. We are no longer recommending that you use reporting_unit as the message recipient for message schedules. Instead, use clinic (to send to the patient’s CHW), health_center (to send to the nurse / primary contact of the health center), or district (to send to the primary contact at the district level). This will help ensure that phone numbers are updated in real time. Using reporting_unit for auto-replies and notifications is completely fine as these go out immediately after a report is received. The exception to this might be in cases where both nurses and CHWs are confirming visits and/or deliveries via SMS and you want to notify the CHW. More on this below.\nYour config will look something like this (**See the Standard app_settings.json file for a full example):\n{ \"name\": \"ANC Reminders LMP\", \"translation_key\": \"schedule.anc_lmp\", \"summary\": \"\", \"description\": \"\", \"start_from\": \"lmp_date\", \"messages\": [ { \"translation_key\": \"messages.schedule.anc.reminder\", \"group\": 1, \"offset\": \"12 weeks\", \"send_day\": \"monday\", \"send_time\": \"09:00\", \"recipient\": \"clinic\" }, { \"translation_key\": \"messages.schedule.anc.followup\", \"group\": 1, \"offset\": \"13 weeks\", \"send_day\": \"monday\", \"send_time\": \"10:00\", \"recipient\": \"clinic\" },] } [#3627]","new-date-filter#New Date Filter":"Now you can format dates on condition cards in the way that most of the world talks about them: date then month.

Now you can display dates like birthdates or EDDs in the format shown below (DD Month). This makes the date easier to read at a glance. If you want your date to show up in this format, use the dayMonth filter for date fields in your contact-summary.js file.\n[#3721]","permissions-to-showhide-call-and-message-buttons#Permissions to Show/Hide Call and Message Buttons":"Call me, maybe.\nWe’ve added two new permissions to our list so that you can determine whether users should see the call and message buttons when they are viewing a person’s profile.

You’ll need to run sentinel transitions for these to work. All of these fields can be added to SMS forms and some can be added to app forms. Here’s a list of what’s been added:\nAny report that runs the registration transition and invokes the add_patient (or deprecated add_patient_id) trigger will create a patient doc with a source_id field referencing the report and a created_by field referencing the ID of the contact who submitted the report. This makes it possible to know who created each person and links the person to the form used to register them. Any report that clears a schedule either via the accept_patient_reports transition or the clear_schedule trigger in the registration transition will have the ID of the latest matching registration recorded in the registration_id field. If you register a pregnancy and then submit a V form, the V form will have a registration_id which is the ID of the most recent pregnancy registration. If you submit a D form for a pregnancy that was previously registered, the D form will have a registration_id which is the ID of the most recent pregnancy registration. This also applies to any other schedule that is generated by registering a patient (PNC, Immunizations, etc.). Any visit form will have the ID of the most recent registration. Any scheduled message that is cleared before being sent will have a cleared_by field with the report that caused the task to be cleared. If you register a pregnancy and receive the first visit reminder (Please remind Janet to go to the clinic for ANC), then submit a V form, the second reminder (Did Janet attend her visit?) would be cleared. That reminder would have a cleared_by field which is the ID of the V form. If you register a pregnancy and then send in a D form, all remaining reminders are cleared. Each of the reminders would have a cleared_by field which is the ID of the V form. This also applied to any other scheduled messages that are cleared - we will always know which report cleared the message.

Now you’ll be able to see the patient name associated with the pregnancy from the main list of the Reports tab.\nPreviously, the Reports tab displayed the name of the person who submitted a particular report. We received feedback that it was more useful to display the name of the patient, so we have updated the reports list and the report detail page to show the patient’s name at the top.\nIn the reports list, we show the patient’s name first so that a CHW or manager can easily see which patient the report is about. Next is the type of form, which is the same as in previous versions. Below the name of the form, we have included the patient’s hierarchy so that it’s easy to see at a glance which CHW area that patient belongs to.\nIf you then click on a report, you get to the report detail view, which again shows the patient’s name at the top. Below is the name of the form, which is the same as in previous versions. After the form name is the patient’s hierarchy, so it’s clear which CHW area the patient belongs to. Finally, we list the person who sent the report and that person’s phone number. In this case it’s the CHW, Brandon Bone, but it could also be a nurse or another person in the health system. If the phone number does not match anyone in the Medic system, it will simply show the phone number of the person who submitted the report with no name listed.\n[#4053]","updated-enketo-ui#Updated Enketo UI":"UI fairy dust alert!

They are back.\nWhen we started having CHWs log into the Medic app and register families, the places filter on the reports page became crowded with thousands of families, creating a performance issue. To get around that issue, we removed 'clinic' level places from this filter drop-down so that users would only see health centers and CHW areas, no families. This meant that no one could filter by family, but that wasn’t a needed feature.","whats-new#What\u0026rsquo;s New":""},"title":"2.15.0"},"/releases/2_16_0/":{"data":{"":"","ability-to-add-more-user-roles#Ability to add more user roles":"Because CHW Janet, CHW Supervisor Ann, and Paul the Data Guy don’t wear the same hat in real life and now they don’t have to in the app, either.\nIn order to make it possible to show the UHC mode features for some CHWs and not others, we decided to go ahead and implement configurable user roles. Up until now, we were limited to one user role for users that need offline access to their data. You have probably heard of the “restricted” user - this is the user type that allowed a CHW or manager to access data offline. However, this was limiting because every user that had offline data access had to have the same set of permissions. So, for example, a CHW and a supervisor had to have the same set of permissions, requiring both to have the permission to do something (such as delete reports) or neither would have permission to do it. This led to restrictions in what supervisors could do in order to avoid giving too many permissions to CHWs.\nWith 2.16.0, we now have configurable roles! This means that a CHW and a supervisor can both access data offline but can have unique roles so that they can have different permissions. For example, a CHW might not be able to delete data, review reports, or bulk delete, but a supervisor could be given the ability to do one or more of these actions without affecting the permissions of the CHW.\nNew roles can be created in the configuration pages. Instead of a permissions page, we now have a roles \u0026 permissions page. On this page we have a new tab for creating and managing user roles. Creating a new user role is as simple as creating a name and translation key for the user role and making sure you select the “Offline” checkbox if this user type needs access to data offline.\nScreenshot\nThe permissions page has also been updated to better accommodate a greater number of roles. We’ve changed the layout to a new format. This layout is temporary for now and we expect to improve it later in the year. You can see in this example that we now have roles for Supervisor, CHW and Online User, but you can create as many roles as you need, both for users that need access to data offline and for those accessing the app online.\nScreenshot\n[#4525]","add-new-statuses-to-the-status-filter-on-the-reports-page#Add new statuses to the status filter on the reports page":"Because even Superheros could use some help organizing their Inbox.\nWith the new feature that allows managers to review reports, we’ve updated the status filter to help managers easily find reports they need to review or reports they marked as having errors that need follow up. With these changes, we have retained the ability to filter by valid and invalid SMS reports. Here’s what happens when you select each of these filter options:\nManager review - “Not reviewed”: displays all valid reports (SMS and app) that have not been marked as correct or having errors by a manager Manager review - “Reviewed: errors”: displays all reports (app or SMS) that were marked as having errors by a manager Manager review - “Reviewed: correct”: displays all reports (app or SMS) that were marked as correct by a manager SMS validity - “Valid SMS”: displays all SMS reports that were valid when received (regardless of whether they are “Not reviewed”, “Reviewed: errors”, or “Reviewed: correct”) SMS validity - “Invalid SMS”: displays all SMS reports that were invalid when received and have red dots (applied automatically) For example, if a manager wanted to review any recent patient assessments that they might have access to, she would filter by the patient assessment form type and the “Manager review - Not reviewed” status filter. This would give a list of assessment forms that have not yet been reviewed.\nComparison","after#After":"Screenshot\n[#4577]","after-1#After":"Screenshot\n[#4576]","allow-death-confirmation-form-to-specify-the-date-of-death#Allow death confirmation form to specify the date of death":"Because the only thing worse than getting your birthday wrong is…\nIn 2.15.0, we added support for death reporting workflows. One glitch we realized was that the date of death was being set to the date that the death confirmation form was submitted. With 2.16.0, we’ve added an improvement to the workflow. It’s now possible to set a specific date of death in your death confirmation form. This makes the workflow more flexible by allowing a nurse to enter the confirmed date of death in the death confirmation form.\nIn order to include a user-selected date of death as the official date of death listed in the Medic app, you’ll need to make sure there is a field in the death confirmation form that lists the exact date of death and then indicate in your app_settings that this field should be used for the date of death.\nExample XLSForm with date_of_death field:\nScreenshot\nExample app_settings configuration:\n\"transitions\": { \"death_reporting\": true }, \"death_reporting\": { \"mark_deceased_forms\": [ \"death_confirmation\" ], \"undo_deceased_forms\": [ \"undo_death\" ], \"date_field\": \"fields.date_of_death\" } [#4636]","allow-supervisors-to-review-specific-patient-reports#Allow supervisors to review specific patient reports":"We call this feature Super-Vision! Supervisors now have the magical ability to see reports about patients without being able to view the patients themselves. #superpowers-for-supervisors\nApart from Standard, where we have very small numbers of users, supervisors are not able to view all patient reports due to device storage limits and app performance issues. However, there may be times when there are specific reports about patients that supervisors need to see, review, or take action on. This feature is not meant to allow supervisors to view all patient reports about every patient and it does not give supervisors the ability to see patient profiles. It is meant to better support workflows like reviewing mRDT images or confirming death reports. Currently, if a supervisor wanted to review an mRDT image in a patient assessment form or get a death confirmation task, she would need to have access to the patient. With this new feature, the supervisor only needs access to the patient assessment form or the death report form in order to do the review or receive the task.\nBelow you’ll see the Reports page from the supervisor’s view. In this example, the supervisor has access to families and family reports, but does not have access to patients. Using this feature, we’ve configured it so that the supervisor does have access to patient assessment forms so that they can be reviewed, even though she doesn’t have access to the patients themselves. As you can see in the screenshots below, the CHW has access to all patient- and family-level reports while the supervisor has access to all family-level reports AND the patient assessment report, but no other patient-level reports.\nComparison\nIf you want a report submitted by the CHW about a patient to be viewable by the supervisor, you’ll need to make sure that the supervisor has access to families (replication_depth of 2 in most cases) but no access to patients. You will also need to add a field to the patient-level form that the supervisor needs access to. The field should be a hidden field called needs_signoff that must be set to true in cases where the report needs to be reviewed by a manager. For example, if you only wanted a manager to review patient assessments where an mRDT was conducted, come up with a conditional statement to set the variable to true only for assessments where the mRDT was done. This hidden field must be a top-level field (not in any group and will be in doc.fields.needs_signoff when you submit). To test, upload your form with this field, fill it out and submit. Log in as a user who is the supervisor of the CHW who submitted the form and make sure you are able to see the form you just submitted.\nExample XLSForm: XLSForm\n[#4591]","before#Before":"Screenshot","before-1#Before":"Screenshot","bug-fixes#Bug Fixes":"","changed-use-of-colored-dot-on-the-reports-page#Changed use of colored dot on the reports page":"Seeing spots?

If they don’t go away, consult a tech lead or your family eye doctor.\nOur use of the controversial “green dot” and “red dot” on the reports page hearkens back to the days when 100% of Medic users where using SMS. It was a quick way to see which reports were valid and which were not. Once we started having users on the mobile app, this feature became less useful because every single report was valid. This is because we have more control over how the data is entered and do not rely on the end user entering a valid Medic ID. We decided to modernize our use of red and green dots so that they make more sense across our SMS and app projects. Here’s our new approach:\nWe’ve removed the green dot completely from valid incoming reports. No dot = all good here = no attention needed. This is regardless of whether it came from the mobile app, a TextForm, or Medic Collect. Without green dots on every report, red and green dots now have more meaning. Using our new manager review feature (#4529), a manager can now use a green dot to indicate that a form is correct, and a red dot if it contains an error. We also know that it’s important to be able to see invalid reports coming in over SMS, either TextForms or Collect forms. For these invalid SMS reports, the red dot with an “x” is automatically applied. You can filter to see all invalid SMS reports by using the status filter dropdown. Here’s a summary of how the red and green dots now work: Comparison\nHere’s a look at the reports list so you can see the before and after:\nComparison\nThe screenshot on the left shows the current use of dots for an SMS project. On a mobile app project, there’s a green dot on every report.\nIn the screenshot on the right, we’ve removed the green dots from valid reports. The green dot can be applied when a supervisor has reviewed a report and marked it correct. The red dot for invalid SMS reports is still automatically applied. Additionally, a supervisor can review a report and apply the red dot if the report has errors.\nThe supervisor review feature is optional and should only be encouraged if it’s part of their workflow. It’s also perfectly fine for supervisors to use it selectively - to only mark reports with errors or to only review certain reports (such as mRDT, but not child assessments). The intention isn’t to give supervisors more review work but to reduce the noise on the Reports page and make the information that gets shown there more meaningful.\n[#4574]","expand-use-of-the-verify-button-for-manager-review-of-chw-reports#Expand use of the verify button for manager review of CHW reports":"The exciting world of data cleaning just got better.\nWe’ve created a new and improved verification workflow for managers. Before, we just had two states for each report, verified and unverified. A report was verified by clicking the verify button.\nComparison\nWith the new feature, clicking on the verify button opens a small menu with two options: Correct and Has errors. This allows a manager to review a report and mark it correct if it looks good and mark it as having errors if they need to follow up with the CHW for further verification. The status will also be synced to the CHW’s phone so they can see which reports were marked correct by their manager and which were marked as having errors.\nWith our new configurable roles, it is also possible for managers to have the ability to review reports while preventing CHWs from having this option, even if both are restricted/offline-first users.\nThis feature was built to support the mRDT error-checking workflow for the Muso Innovation Network. Supervisors must log in to view photos of the mRDTs (built in 2.14.0) and check that the diagnosis reported by the CHW matches the photos. If the supervisor sees an error, they can now use this feature to mark it as such. Error rates are part of the CHW’s performance metrics so supervisors can see which CHWs are in need of additional training on implementing mRDTs. To complement this workflow, we built a widget on the CHP’s Targets page to accompany this workflow that tracks their monthly error rate.\nComparison\n[#4529]","fixed-a-performance-issue-with-loading-contacts#Fixed a performance issue with loading contacts":"CHWs see a lot of people every day. That’s a lot of searching! We’ve improved search performance by 30% which really adds up.\nLoading contacts is now done with an allDocs request instead of using custom views. This improves performance of searching on the people tab and on the reports tab. It’s a workaround for now as we look further into the root cause of the slowness.

This icon is for sorting the list of people. The default sort is alphabetical, as you have probably noticed. The new icon allows you to sort your families or households by the date last visited. You will need to enable the permission for viewing the date last visited and configure one or more forms to be included in the calculation of the last visit date for each family (see previous section). Once you’ve done that, the sort will just work. By default, when you sort by “date last visited,” the households you saw least recently will be at the top, gradually increasing to those you saw most recently. Because you know, you should prioritize the households who haven’t been seen in the longest amount of time.\nFun fact: We drew this feature for the first time while chatting about visit practices in a workshop with LG CHPs in Uganda. See the drawings on the lower right that shows a family list being reordered by date, with those visited least recently at the top.\nImage\nComparison\n#4524","toggle-universal-health-coverage-mode-on-and-off#Toggle Universal Health Coverage mode on and off":"We’re not trying to play bi-partisan politics, we’re just trying to test some new features.\nShowing the date last visited and being able to sort contacts by the date they were last visited by a CHW are the first two features designed to achieve Universal Health Coverage (UHC). While the world is quickly catching onto the importance of this, we know that not all programs are ready to implement this approach. Feature #4525 makes it possible to turn these UHC features on or off. It’s still very early in our UHC design process so we’ll be closely monitoring these features and conduct feedback sessions, so the UHC features previously described may still undergo some iteration. Check on the status of these features before implementing them in your project.\nAs was described earlier, enabling UHC mode is as simple as giving a user the permission can_view_last_visited_date. This will give the user the last visit date in the people list and the ability to sort by the last visit date. Make sure you add the needed field to the forms you want to include as part of the last visit date calculation to avoid having a long list of “Last visit unknown”. Once CHWs start submitting these forms, the dates on the list will slowly update.\nComparison\n[#4525]","updated-google-libphonenumber#Updated google-libphonenumber":"Now you can change your number to avoid your ex without missing a single Medic reminder.\nWe’ve updated to the latest google-libphonenumber to make sure our app will accept new phone numbers across all of the countries where we work.

Comparison","use-family-equity-score-in-tasks-and-actions-about-family-members#Use family equity score in tasks and actions about family members":"Jokes aside, this features is an important step in being able to deliver a preferential option for the poor. Read more about this here: https://www.pih.org/article/in-the-company-of-the-poor\nLast year, we began implementing an equity survey in Kenya that determines a household’s wealth quintile based on a number of questions about their home, possessions, and access to safe drinking water, among other things. Although the wealth quintile could be used to generate tasks for the household, we wanted to make the equity quintile useful in targeting interventions at the patient level. With this feature, we’re now able to use the equity score to generate specific tasks about patients, such as increasing the number of pregnancy follow-ups for women in poorer households. We’re also able to display specific notes or questions within forms for patients in lower wealth quintiles, such as asking additional questions about children in poorer households when they are being screened for malnutrition. This feature makes the equity score more usable in patient workflows and is the first step toward greater targeting of services.\nWe’re still learning how to deliver this feature well. We’ve heard from CHWs that they resist the approach that some families in their community would be “labeled” as poor in the app, even if they acknowledge that they prioritize these families differently in their daily workflows. Though this feature allows that “labeling” to happen on the backend, it may be helpful and important for a CHW to know why a family or patient has been asked these additional questions or given more frequent home visits. The Impact and Design teams are currently getting feedback on appropriate options. Consult your designer and share back what you’re thinking and trying so we can all learn together!\nThe feature works by pulling specific fields from a form filled at the family level and copying them to the profile of each family member in the household. For now, we are limited to the national quintile and the urban quintile. We don’t pull the raw scores, just the quintiles, which are easier to use in tasks and forms. To make sure your quintiles get copied, simply make sure that you have fields called NationalQuintile and UrbanQuintile defined as top-level fields in the form you’re using at the household level. These must end up at doc.fields.NationalQuintile and doc.fields.UrbanQuintile for this feature to work correctly.","view-date-last-visited-for-places-on-the-people-tab#View date last visited for places on the people tab":"Because knowing where you’ve been helps you know where you’re going next! - Medic proverb\nIn order to help CHWs achieve full coverage of every family or household they care for, we’ve added an optional feature to update the list of families or areas to display the date that family or area was last visited. You can use any patient- or family-level form or forms to update the date last visited. You may run into performance issues if you configure this to look at forms submitted very frequently. For example, we expect five forms submitted only once a month to work better than two forms submitted every day. Make sure you test!\nScreenshot\nIn order to see the date last visited instead of the primary contact, make sure you give your CHWs (or whichever users need to see date last visited) the can_view_last_visited_date permission. Once that permission is enabled, you’ll be able to display the date the family was last visited in the list. Make sure you have this permission enabled in app_settings to avoid overwriting the permission when you upload your config:\n{ \"name\": \"can_view_last_visited_date\", \"roles\": [ \"chw\", \"district_admin\" ] } When you first implement this, you’ll see a long list of “Last visit unknown”. You’ll need to indicate which forms should be included in the calculation for the date last visited. You can use forms at the person or family level, though it is preferable to limit the number of forms included to the minimal number to avoid performance issues.\nIndicating that a form should be included in the calculation for the date last visited is as simple as adding a field called visited_contact_uuid to your form. This should be a calculate field that contains the family/household (clinic level place) UUID. Make sure this is a top-level field (not in any group and will be in doc.fields.visited_contact_uuid when you submit). To test, upload your form with this field, fill it out and submit, and your people list will update with the correct relative date. Note that you may need to refresh the people tab by either clicking refresh or navigating to another tab and then back.\nExample XLSForm (this is a patient-level form):\nScreenshot\n[#4526]","whats-new#What\u0026rsquo;s New":""},"title":"2.16.0"},"/releases/2_16_1/":{"data":{"":"","show-an-icon-next-to-families-or-areas-that-are-overdue-for-a-visit#Show an icon next to families or areas that are overdue for a visit":"As the ICONic Britney Spears once sang, “Show me a siiiiiign… [visit] me, baby, one more time!”\nIn order to help CHWs achieve full coverage of every family or household they care for, we added a feature in 2.16 to update the list of families or areas to display the date that family or area was last visited.

This is because some partners may follow the Western calendar literally, while other partners have different definitions of a month (ex: Muso counts from the 26th of one month until the 25th of the next month). Whatever forms have been configured to calculate “Date last visited” will be the same forms used to calculate “Visits this month.” Please note this will be a straightforward count of forms submitted and cannot be configured to only include a max number of forms in a particular time frame, such as “per day.”\nThese visit counts are also available to be conditionally styled. If the partner has no specific goals, just like with Targets, the text is normal black. If the partner does have specific goals, we use red to indicate “bad”, yellow to indicate “ok” and green to indicate “good” or “goal met.” It is also possible to display an icon next to the count number.

[#1002] The /api/v1/fti endpoint has been removed due to security concerns and lack of use. [#1002]","uses-horticulturalist-for-installation-and-upgrades#Uses Horticulturalist for installation and upgrades":"Previous Situation: To install and update the Medic webapp on a server we used an application called Gardener. It is a web-based tool to manage CouchDB applications. It includes a tool, called Dashboard, which lets you install Medic. You could then upgrade the Medic application using that same web-based tool. Problem: Although Dashboard made it easy to install and upgrade an application, it was problematic when managing many deployments. For instance, upgrading all instances required manually clicking the Upgrade button in a webpage. This process is tedious, and only worked if you were on a good internet. We learned the hard way that doing an upgrade from a spotty connection could leave your instance in a broken state. Also, you only had the choice to upgrade to the very latest version of the app. That means that if you are on 2.14.0, you could not update just to 2.14.5, the same version but with fixes for bugs. You’d have to upgrade all the way to 2.18.0. Solution: Horticulturalist is a new and easy way to deploy and update Medic. Horti replaces the Market, Gardener and Dashboard as our standard way to deploy and manage our software. It can be used from the Medic Mobile admin webapp to select the specific version that you want to upgrade to. You can even select versions from a different branch to help with acceptance testing of new features. It can also be used via a computer terminal using the command line interface. This makes it easy for the Site Reliability Engineering team to manage instances, making sure that projects quickly get updates to use the most stable version of Medic tools.\n[#3993 ….]","value-for-db-doc-attribute-is-case-sensitive#Value for db-doc attribute is case sensitive":"Previously the db-doc attribute in XLSforms only accepted the lower-case “true.” It now accepts “TRUE” as well, which is what we got often got with Excel doing autocorrect.

This task now runs every day, at 2am UTC, and replicates feedback and telemetry documents to medic-users-meta database.\nAndroid wrapper update required for new features Supporting remote first-time login is only fully functional while using medic-android version 0.5.0 or later.\nSentinel no longer advances its transition processing seq in _local/sentinel-meta-data Instead, it advances the transition processing seq in _local/transitions-seq. Additionally, a new document _local/background-seq advances the deletion processing seq. A new migration is run when upgrading to generate the new local files.\nSupported software There are no required changes to the supported software matrix from 3.0.0.\nNode CouchDB Browsers SMS bridge Android medic-android medic-couch2pg 8.11+ 2.1+ Chrome 53+, Firefox latest medic-gateway 4.4+ 0.4.5+ 3.0+ Supporting remote first-time login 3.10.0 adds a new authentication mechanism that doesn’t require users to know their username or password. Users can now access the app for the first time by clicking on a link that they receive by SMS. Admins can enable or disable this feature for any user. Users with the latest version of medic-android will have the option to open the weblink directly in the CHT app instead of a browser.\nToken login\nSee the documentation for more information.\nSupporting linked docs To support the ability of sending SMS messages to people that are not primary contacts, contact documents now expose a new property, linked_docs, that can contain a collection of ids representing documents that are relevant to the respective contact. Every document listed in linked_docs will be shallowly hydrated when the contact is hydrated, thus providing a means of accessing the contents of these related documents everywhere the contact is used within the app. This feature can have a multitude of applications, from providing a way to access an arbitrary contact’s phone number when resolving an SMS recipient to linking a delivery report to a child person document (linked_docs can also be used in contact-summary). See the documentation for more information.\nPrivacy Policies App builders can now configure privacy policies for every language. When a privacy policy is configured for a language, users who load the app in this language are prompted to accept the policy after logging in, and are blocked from using the app until they have accepted. Privacy policies can be configured using medic-conf or from a new App Management page.\nPrivacy policies\nSee the documentation for more information.\nMore granular replication depth configuration for offline users A new report_depth option was added to the replication_depth configuration. This option allows offline users to replicate and report on contacts deeper in the hierarchy without having to replicate reports about those contacts that were created by other users. See the documentation for more information.\nImproved geolocation data 3.10.0 improves the way geolocation data is obtained. Previously, if the app was not able to obtain a position lock immediately, the geolocation would not be recorded. Now, the app will allow up to 30 seconds to get a position lock. Additionally, the geolocation property is now updated every time a report is edited, and all previous geolocation entries are saved in a log within the same report. This change also supports the updates in medic-android version 0.5.0, where the Location permission is requested at runtime rather than when starting the app for the first time.\nImproved performance of processing deleted docs Because processing document deletes, specifically deleting read docs, is relatively time-consuming, increasing linearly with the number of users that exist on the instance, deletion processing is now split into:\ngenerating tombstones: no changes, tombstones are generated like before, within the Sentinel transition processing feed. deleting read docs and info docs: done

You’ll see errors on these tabs and the console error Rules Engine: Updates to the nools schema are required if the configuration is not compatible with 3.8. All “3.8 compatible” configurations are backward compatible and can be deployed safely to any Core Framework version. It is therefore recommended to deploy the “3.8 compatible” configuration before upgrading so your application will work seamlessly once the upgrade completes.\nFor partners using declarative configuration, ensure your configuration is deployed using medic-conf 3.1.0 or greater. For partners maintaining their configuration in the legacy rules.nools.js file, ensure the latest schema changes are deployed. These changes also result in new constraints for partner application task and target code:\nTasks with multiple actions cannot use different contacts for their actions[n].content.contact values. For example, one action cannot open a form for contact x and a second action for the same task open a form for contact y. Reports “with errors” are now available in all task and target calculations (instead of just some calculations) and partner code is responsible for filtering them as necessary. For partners maintaining their configuration in a rules.nools.js file, multiple contacts emitting tasks with conflicting id values is no longer supported. This will result in errant behavior in 3.8.0. Target emissions with conflicting ids were previously merged based on the order in which the requesting contact was created inside CouchDB. It is now merged based on the order of the requesting contact’s reported_date attribute. The specific meaning of task “resolution” has been augmented to accommodate the additional complexities of reporting a task’s “state” in Postgres. Read the documentation for more information. A task’s content is cached inside the task document. Any timestamps or calculation can be up to seven days old.

Many of these changes are hard to succinctly summarize and will vary greatly across project configurations and user types. Here are some performance changes you can expect in 3.8.0:\nLess Memory Usage - The retained JS heap size for idle users has been reduced. This reduction is significant for users with many reports or users with large reports. The retained JS heap size for our heaviest known users has been reduced by ~75%! Large First Sync After Upgrade - Expect longer than normal sync times for the first sync after the upgrade to 3.8.0. Some users may see hundreds of new task documents created on their device when they use the app after upgrading. These new documents need to sync to the server. Increased Disk Usage - Writing task and target documents into PouchDB means the Core Framework will require more disk usage. Reduced Time to Bootstrap - The bootstrapping step Loading rules… has been removed. This results in drastically reduced bootstrapping times that remain constant regardless of document count. After the user’s first replication and load, all users should be able to restart the app and bootstrap within one minute. Long First-Load Time for the Tasks and Targets Tabs - The loading previously done during the Loading rules… bootstrap step now loads the first time a user navigates to the “Tasks” tab or the “Targets” tab. Expect long load times the first time one of these tabs is viewed. But it is only once, even if the user closes the app. Net Performance Gains - After the first-load of the “Tasks” tab or the “Targets” tab, the tabs will load from a persistent cache. The cache is much faster than the first-load experience, but the tabs will load slower than in previous Core Framework versions. This is a performance trade-off which aims to reduce the time to complete operations in CHT app. The net result is a drastically reduced bootstrap time, and a slightly increased load time for specific tabs which provides a net reduction in load times for users to complete tasks. These trade-offs are complex and we’d love to hear how these changes affect your users and your configuration.

Often, the replication_depth configuration is used to limit how much of the contact hierarchy is visible to a user (and downloaded to their device) by preventing the replication of contacts/reports beyond a specified depth.\nHowever, in some cases this configuration is not sufficient. For example, perhaps a CHW Supervisor needs to have access to the contact data for the CHWs they supervise (including the reports for those contacts), but should not have access to all the households/patients served by those CHWs. A typical hierarchy (as seen here) might have the CHW contact and the family household contacts both at the same depth level as children of the CHW Area. If the supervisor user is configured to have a replication depth of 1, they will not have access to the CHW contact. If the replication depth is set to 2, the supervisor will have access to all the household contacts.\nIn this case, the new replicate_primary_contacts configuration can be used to ensure the primary contacts of the places at the user’s deepest replication depth are also replicated (even if those contacts are technically located deeper in the hierarchy than the configured depth limit). So, with a replication depth of 1 and replicate_primary_contacts set to true, the supervisor user will have access to the CHW contact, but not the household contacts.\n#8034: Add config to allow replicating primary contacts for places at max depth","rest-endpoints-for-getting-contacts-and-reports#REST Endpoints for Getting Contacts and Reports":"New REST endpoints have been added to the CHT API server for retrieving data about contacts and reports.

Because purging is an action that runs on a schedule, relatively infrequently due to how performance expensive it is, caching results from these very expensive queries significantly improves server-side performance.\nAs of 4.4.0, the CHT caches the purged doc ids for each user that replicates. The cache is reset when purging runs next time and when user replication settings change.

It packs security fixes, performance and scalability improvements and a plethora of bug fixes.\nMost notable features are:\nImproved clustering and node management APIs Adding the _reshard endpoint, which allows splitting a shard into two shards. In CouchDb v2, adding additional shards was not possible without creating a new database with the desired number of shards, and replicating existent data to the new database. For the CHT, this meant that all users would need to re-sync if additional shards were added. Adding a new _prometheus endpoint, which exposes CouchDb metrics and can be used out of the box in monitoring visualisation tools, like the CHT Watchdog. Improved security, where database creation and writes/reads are no longer allowed for all users by default. Improved security, where only CouchDb admins are allowed to add/edit/delete users. Dramatically improved multi-core CPU usage, resulting in better performance when running on powerful machines.

Achieving reliable performance and powerful features requires diligence and strict adherence to the principles of Offline-First development.\nIn this page we’ll cover why and how we achieve this in the CHT.","code#Code":"The CHT uses a Service Worker to store the code needed to start up and run which is best practice for caching web applications. The CHT Core Framework code is downloaded when the user visits the login page for the first time and completes silently in the background while the user logs in.\nThe code includes JavaScript, CSS, HTML, fonts, and images. It doesn’t contain any private information so it’s safe to download and cache it without authentication. It also doesn’t contain deployment specific configuration (covered in detail below).\nThe CHT Core Framework checks for updates to the code by attempting to connect to the server in the background. The user isn’t notified if this check fails or times out, so they can continue to complete workflows without interruption. When an update is found the new code is downloaded and the service worker cache is updated. The user is prompted to reload to start using the new version of the application, but this can be dismissed if they are busy with a patient or don’t want to lose their progress if they are midway through an action like creating a contact or completing a form. Either way, the update will be automatically applied the next time the application starts up.","data#Data":"Once the application has started up it needs data to be useful. This data falls into two categories:\nConfiguration specific to a single deployment such as forms, task definitions, places, and hierarchies. Patient data such as personal details, information about visits, reports, tasks, and messages. Both of these types of data are cached on the device because they are required for the user to do their job. The CHT Core Framework uses PouchDB to store the data on the device’s disk. Once cached, when the application starts up the code is executed, which reads the data, allowing the user to do their job regardless of the quality of their internet connection.\nIf the user creates new patient data by registering a family or completing a task the application stores this in the phone’s cache and attempts to submit this to the server. Periodically the application checks to see if there is new data on the server that is relevant to the user and if so, it updates the cache. This process of sending and receiving data updates is called replication, and is performed without interrupting the user from their work.","faqs-from-cht-contributors#FAQs from CHT contributors":"Q: Should I rely on request failure handling? A: No. This only works well when the user has a strong connection, or if the user is completely offline and the request fails immediately. It’s impossible to know for sure how long the request will take, so users with poor connectivity may end up waiting forever. If this request is essential to doing their job they will be unable to move on. It is important to handle request failures gracefully, but it doesn’t make a request offline first. Q: Should I rely on a request timeout? A: No. This attempts to mitigate the problem by unblocking the user eventually. The problem is setting the timeout length correctly - if it’s too short then the request won’t succeed, but if it’s too long the user will be required to wait. Experience suggests the timeout for a simple request would have to be around a minute to allow the request to succeed for most users, but a minute is far too long to expect a user to wait. Almost all requests should have a timeout, but that is not sufficient to make a request offline first. Q: Should I rely on a spinner or loading bar? A: No. Much like the timeout solution, this is an attempt to mitigate the problem in this case by giving the user more information about the request. Regardless of the UX, blocking user interaction while waiting for a response is not offline first and therefore not appropriate for the CHT. Showing UX elements when loading is still recommended for local requests, user initiated server requests, and other potentially slow operations. Q: How can I check if the user is authenticated? A: It is not possible to know for certain if a user has an active session without getting a response from the server. The CHT caches some data to hint at whether the session is still active, for example the session expiry date. However, the only way to be certain is to connect to the server, which is not offline first. This has been implemented in the CHT by checking the status code on background requests such as replication, and instructing the user to login when necessary. Q: Should I rely on APIs which report device connection status? A: No. There are APIs available which report whether the device is online with reasonable reliability. Unfortunately these APIs don’t reliably report whether the connection is slow, whether the connection will be held until the request completes, or whether the CHT server is available. This means that even if the browser API reports that the device is online the code will still make a request that may fail or wait indefinitely for a response. These APIs can be useful but must be used in conjunction with Offline-First principles, for example, the CHT uses the “online” event listener as a prompt to attempt replication in the background. Q: Should I add a feature that requires a connection? A: Maybe. There are some things that cannot be done offline first because they either require server interaction (eg: authentication during login) or they need to access data that cannot be cached locally (eg: deployment-wide analytics). Every effort should be made to find a way to implement the feature using Offline-First principles, and trade-offs discussed with senior CHT contributors. If the feature truly needs to be online first then the UX needs to be designed so that the user understands the feature requires an internet connection.","further-reading#Further reading":"Designing Offline-First Web Apps by A List Apart A Design Guide for Building Offline First Apps by Hasura CouchDB takes CHT to the front lines of healthcare work by CouchDB","requirements#Requirements":"","why-this-is-important#Why this is important":"The CHT is designed to improve healthcare in the hardest to reach communities.

The CHT is built to support the delivery of quality community health care at the last mile. The CHT is designed to work in areas with low connectivity, which means it is an Offline-First toolkit for care provision. The architectural and technology choices in the stack are mostly guided by this principle, which will be evident in the discussion of the data management pipeline.","1-data-collection#1. Data Collection":"Data is collected in the community at the point of care, i.e. the community health worker interacting with the toolkit. These tools and their corresponding data stores are::-\nMobile app -\u003e PouchDB Webapp -\u003e PouchDB / CouchDB Text forms / sms -\u003e SMS gateway / SMS aggregator -\u003e CouchDB The mobile app and webapp, when deployed for offline first use, use a local database namely PouchDB. Similar to CouchDB, it is a document-oriented database. The data collected in PouchDB is synced to an online CouchDB upon the user connecting to the internet. Local storage is not applicable to SMS; instead, an SMS gateway or an SMS aggregator (for example Africa’s Talking) is used to help get the data to an online CouchDB instance.\nUltimately all the data ends up in a CouchDB instance deployed in the cloud whether through data synchronization with PouchDB local to the health workers devices, use of SMS aggregators or gateway. It should be mentioned that you can have a deployment supported by all of webapp, mobile app and SMS and have all the data end up in the same CouchDB instance.","2-data-transformation#2. Data Transformation":"CHT Sync is used to move data from CouchDB to a relational database, PostgreSQL in this case. The choice of PostgreSQL for analytics dashboard data sources is to allow use of the more familiar SQL querying. It is an open source tool that can be easily deployed. When deployed the service uses CouchDB’s changes feed which allows capturing of everything happening in CouchDB in incremental updates. It is run and monitored by the operating system where it is configured to fetch data at a configurable interval.\nData copied over to PostgreSQL is first stored as raw json (document) making use of PostgreSQL’s jsonb data type to create an exact replica of a CouchDB database. From this, default views are created at deployment of the service and refreshed during every subsequent run. Additional custom materialized views created later are also refreshed at this time.\nCustom materialized views and functions are added specific to a deployment’s needs. Generally the following naming convention is recommended:\nformview as a view of raw forms useview as a view of form data supporting a use case as defined by design contactview as a view of people and places Database functions are used as a way to join as much relevant data as possible for easier querying in analytics or dashboard visualizations. Data in the views and functions mentioned in this section is as accurate as the accuracy of the SQL queries. Best practice is to begin the process of defining these objects at design in order to align analytics and dashboards requirements with workflows being deployed.","3-data-use#3. Data Use":"The data in PostgreSQL is mostly either used by direct querying or via dashboard visualizations for impact monitoring and data driven-decision making. Database visualizations are built scoped to the requirements of supporting a successful deployment. The work of our Research \u0026 Learning team, specifically data science, is supported at the PostgreSQL level through updated contactviews, formviews, useviews and functions with access to these provided to relevant parties as and when needed. Our use of data follows our Privacy \u0026 Data Protection policy and is in accordance to agreements with our CHT partners.\nAs mentioned previously, formviews are built to present data in a structure similar to the data collection tool (form) used. Useviews are tailored to align with a use case, mostly using the formviews as the data sources. These are fundamentally guided by design of the workflows and should be interpreted in the context of the design materials including a document explaining the definitions of variables used.\nThe objects present here are not limited to views and functions. Additional tables can be added, for example providing mappings or supporting operations external to the functions available in the toolkit. In short, there is no limitation to the utility that can be added this level to support analytics and dashboards. That said, measures are taken to ensure controlled access, reliability and timely access of the data by the various parties. Some of these measures are:\nRoles and users allocation and deallocation done by specific roles within partner technical teams with support from Medic as needed; Access control management is left to the partner technical teams where possible; Dashboard data source refresh intervals set to align with project needs; Update of the data sources monitored to ensure updating works as expected; Review of the dashboards as part of the design process; Qualitative design activities to interrogate trends observed in the dashboards and iterate on them if need be;","backup#Backup":"The machines running each of CouchDB and PostgreSQL instances are backed up daily.","beyond-our-current-pipeline#Beyond Our Current Pipeline":"The cht-core is mostly data collection tools and is the first component of the data management pipeline.

It also helps that CHT Sync is an open source tool which provides the opportunity for collaboration to extend its functionality to support other implementations. Klipfolio, the tool that we currently use for visualizations, is a proprietary tool but there are many open source options, such as Apache Superset that are worth exploring and building into future iterations of our impact monitoring and analytics support for the CHT.","current-infrastructure#Current infrastructure":"We look at this in three general phases.","details-of-the-data-flow#Details of the data flow":"The layout detailed here is specific to how Medic supports its CHT partners at the moment.

An easy way to do this is to check the contact’s muted property which when present has the date value of when the contact was muted and when absent means that the contact is not muted. This works when you are only interested in seeing the latest data but it gets complicated when you want to look at a contact’s mute state from a certain period in the past.\nFor example, if a contact was muted in February and unmuted in May; If you check the contact’s mute state in March from June, you’d find that the contact would not have the muted property as it would have been removed during the unmute in May. This is where the muting_history comes in. A contact’s muting_history contains all mute and unmute events stored in a JSON array. An example of the mute/unmute entries is shown below:\n{ \"_id\": \"_id\", \"_rev\": \"3-01ecfdd2958baeaf16fc621c5622f4a9\", \"type\": \"info\", \"doc_id\": \"doc-id\", \"transitions\": { }, \"muting_history\": [ { \"date\": \"2021-04-07T13:41:09.769Z\", \"muted\": true, \"report_id\": \"_id\" }, { \"date\": \"2021-06-07T13:41:09.769Z\", \"muted\": false, \"report_id\": \"_id\" } ], \"latest_replication_date\": \"2020-10-30T15:46:45.482Z\", \"initial_replication_date\": \"2020-10-30T15:46:45.482Z\" } If you extract this data into a separate table you can get a timeline that you can use to check if the contact was muted at a certain point in the past. An example of this approach is shown below where the data is first extracted using the query:\nSELECT contact_muting_history.contact_uuid, date AS muted_on, muted, report_id FROM ( SELECT doc -\u003e\u003e 'doc_id' AS contact_uuid, couchdb.doc -\u003e\u003e 'muting_history' AS muting_history FROM couchdb WHERE doc -\u003e\u003e 'type' :: text = 'info' AND doc -\u003e\u003e 'muting_history' IS NOT NULL ) contact_muting_history CROSS JOIN LATERAL json_populate_recordset(null::record, contact_muting_history.muting_history::json) AS (date text, muted bool, report_id uuid); The query above will give you a result set like the one below:\ncontact_uuid muted_on muted report_id 1 2021-06-07T13:41:11.119Z True ***** 2 2020-12-24T18:02:53.190Z True ***** 3 2021-01-24T17:36:31.917Z True ***** 3 2021-04-15T16:56:05.984Z False ***** You can query the table above (mute_timeline) to check if the contact was muted in a certain period in time as shown below:\nSELECT contact_uuid IS NOT NULL AS muted FROM mute_timeline WHERE contact_uuid = ***** AND date_trunc('day',muted_on) \u003c= date_trunc('day', EXAMPLE_DATE) AND unmuted_on \u003e= (date_trunc('day', EXAMPLE_DATE) + '1 day'::interval) This query checks if a record exists for this contact where they were muted earlier or on EXAMPLE_DATE and unmuted on or after the EXAMPLE_DATE. For the earlier example where the contact was muted in February and unmuted in May if we pass February, March, or April as EXAMPLE_DATE, we find a record because our unmuted_on is always greater than EXAMPLE_DATE. If we pass May going forward, we find no records that match our condition."},"title":"Contact Muting in SQL queries"},"/technical-overview/data/analytics/querying_apdex_telemetry/":{"data":{"":"Added in 4.7.0, CHT now records the Apdex (Application Performance Index) that is an open standard for measuring performance of software applications.\nSince Apdex is part of the telemetry system, it is possible to view Apdex data directly from CouchDB.

The CHT maintains a complete change history by tracking all document modifications in a dedicated medic-audit database. For each document in the medic database, there exists a corresponding audit document in medic-audit sharing the same _id. This audit document maintains a chronological record of all changes made to the original document, including creations, modifications and deletions.\nAudit Document Structure Each audit document contains a history array that records all document changes. The audit entries are stored chronologically, with the most recent changes appearing last.\nField Definitions Field Optional Type Description rev no string Document revision (_rev property). date no string Server request timestamp in ISO format service no string Source of change (API or Sentinel) user no string User who initiated the change. If the change is a result of a client request, then the logged in user will be saved, even if the change was made through a separate mechanism (a change cascading or affecting multiple documents). In case the change was made though internal server mechanisms, the admin user for the service will be stored. request_id yes string Client request identifier for api / haproxy log tracing Example audit document:\n{ \"_id\": \"567fd08b-ce83-4b34-a06f-d3b338b474ba\", \"_rev\": \"2-4f412383ef1e3d643a3682081753f492\", \"history\": [ { \"rev\": \"1-c8344ea78152d7471bfcd356b04ca9ae\", \"request_id\": \"9ba2a86d9dbb\", \"user\": \"john\", \"date\": \"2025-06-04T08:45:32.937Z\", \"service\": \"api\" }, { \"rev\": \"2-4864a734c3a0287a2f6c6b9d6d3ed0f2\", \"request_id\": \"284317077052\", \"user\": \"admin\", \"date\": \"2025-06-04T08:47:22.182Z\", \"service\": \"api\" }, { \"rev\": \"3-4f412383ef1e3d643a3682081753f492\", \"user\": \"admin\", \"date\": \"2025-06-04T08:50:30.214Z\", \"service\": \"sentinel\" } ] } Rotation Policy Because some documents are expected to be edited frequently (for example forms, tasks or the settings document), saving all history entries in a single document can make it very large. Storing and retrieving large documents can incur unnecessary stress over the CouchDb database and CHT Service.\nTo avoid audit documents from getting too large, they are rotated at a maximum of 10 history entries . When an audit document has 10 entries and the medic document is changed again, the existent 10 history entries will be saved in a new (rotated) audit doc, and the main audit doc history will only contain the new entry. The rotated audit document will have the _id format of :.\nExample Document Rotation: Rotated Audit Document:\n{ \"_id\": \"567fd08b-ce83-4b34-a06f-d3b338b474ba:10-b5df1417dc0025f605312fb4ddf6702e\", \"_rev\": \"1-4f412383ef1e3d643a3682081753f492\", \"history\": [ ....\u003c9 entries\u003e { \"rev\": \"10-b5df1417dc0025f605312fb4ddf6702e\", \"user\": \"admin\", \"date\": \"2025-06-04T08:50:30.214Z\", \"service\": \"sentinel\" } ] } Main Audit Document After Rotation:\n{ \"_id\": \"567fd08b-ce83-4b34-a06f-d3b338b474ba\", \"_rev\": \"11-c5e90b06e06ee53fd2a762d7aaa43e2f\", \"history\": [ { \"rev\": \"11-3e5008a65d4d08b297ef937bf23fa6a1\", \"user\": \"ted\", \"date\": \"2025-06-04T09:50:30.214Z\", \"service\": \"api\" } ] } Limitations There is no automated cleanup mechanism for audit history. When offline edits sync to the server, they appear as a single audit entry. This is because only the last version of the document is replicated to the server. Because the audit system was added in 4.20.0, older document edits will not be audited. Due to space considerations, audit data is not indexed. A deployment with plenty of disk space can choose to index audit data for quick queries. Examples All the following examples involve querying the audit database using CouchDB Mango queries. Please consult the full documentation for Mango queries from the CouchDB documentation.\nYou can run Mango queries against the medic-audit databse in Fauxton.

You can use purging to remove older documents that are no longer relevant from their devices. Purging only removes documents from user’s devices: these reports are still available for online analytics and impact metrics.\nPurging is disabled by default, and is enabled if a purge function is specified in app_settings.json, along with a run schedule.\nThe following example would purge all reports that were created more than a year ago:\n{ \"//\": \"other app_settings settings\", \"purge\": { \"fn\": \"function(userCtx, contact, reports, messages, chtScriptApi, permissions) { const old = Date.now() - (1000 * 60 * 60 * 24 * 365); return reports.filter(r =\u003e r.reported_date \u003c old).map(r =\u003e r._id);}\", \"text_expression\": \"at 12 am on Sunday\" } } Purging is both very powerful and also very dangerous.

Purging many documents while the application is running is an expensive and potentially disruptive activity, so instead the ids are stored until the next time the app is started.\nThen, when the user launches the app again during the bootstrap phase the app checks if there are any documents to purge, and if so deletes them all before starting up as usual.

The primary use case for this is for Supervisors who manage multiple areas. A video demonstration of setting up a multi-facility user and what this looks like from a user’s perspective can be found on the forum and in the June 2024 CHT Round-up.\nDepth Sometimes though you want to only access contacts near the top of the hierarchy. This may be because returning all contacts would be too much data to be practical, or for patient privacy, or because it’s just not part of your workflow. In this case you can configure a replication depth for a specific role under replication_depth in the app settings.\nIn 3.10, we add the ability to limit replication depth for reports, in conjunction with replication depth for contacts. In 4.18, we add the ability to allow replication of primary contacts and their reports at max depth.","code-sample#Code sample:":"{ \"replication_depth\": [ { \"role\": \"district_manager\", \"depth\": 1, \"report_depth\": 1 }, { \"role\": \"supervisor\", \"depth\": 1, \"report_depth\": 1, \"replicate_primary_contacts\": true }, { \"role\": \"national_manager\", \"depth\": 2 } ] } See Also: Replication Depth","contact-depth#Contact Depth":"Contact depth is calculated relative to the user’s home place, having the user’s facility at depth = 0. Places and contacts that are direct children the facility are on depth = 1, and so on.\nFor example, considering the following contact hierarchy:\ndistrict \u003e health_center \u003e clinic \u003e area \u003e family \u003e patient a supervisor at health_center level, and the following configuration:\n{ \"replication_depth\": [{ \"role\": \"supervisor_role\", \"depth\": }]} The supervisor would download the following contacts and reports, depending on condigured depth:\nDocuments depth=0 depth=1 depth=2 depth=3 health_center ✔ ✔ ✔ ✔ all reports about health_center ✔ ✔ ✔ ✔ person children of health_center ❌ ✔ ✔ ✔ reports about person children of health_center ❌ ✔ ✔ ✔ clinic ❌ ✔ ✔ ✔ all reports about clinic ❌ ✔ ✔ ✔ person children of clinic ❌ ❌ ✔ ✔ reports about person children of clinic ❌ ❌ ✔ ✔ family ❌ ❌ ✔ ✔ all reports about family ❌ ❌ ✔ ✔ person children of family ❌ ❌ ❌ ✔ reports about person children of family ❌ ❌ ❌ ✔","depth#Depth":"","replicate-primary-contacts#Replicate primary contacts":"As of 4.18.0.\nWhen a replication_depth sets replicate_primary_contacts to true, users with the assigned role will replicate the primary contacts of the places they are allowed to see. Primary contacts are replicated even if they are deeper than these users are allowed to download, and even if these contacts belong to other branches of the hierarchy. The primary contact is treated as if it is at the same depth as the place, and will follow the report replication depth of the place.\nFor example, considering the following settings:\n{ \"replication_depth\": [ { \"role\": \"chw\", \"depth\": 2, \"report_depth\": 2, \"replicate_primary_contacts\": true }, { \"role\": \"supervisor\", \"depth\": 2, \"report_depth\": 1, \"replicate_primary_contacts\": true } ], \"contact_types\": [ { \"id\": \"level1\" }, { \"id\": \"level2\", \"parents\": [\"level1\"] }, { \"id\": \"level3\", \"parents\": [\"level2\"] }, { \"id\": \"level4\", \"parents\": [\"level3\"] }, { \"id\": \"level5\", \"parents\": [\"level4\"] }, { \"id\": \"person\", \"parents\": [\"level1\", \"level2\", \"level3\", \"level4\", \"level5\"], \"person\": true s} ] } For the configuration above, a user that has the role chw is allowed to replicate contacts 2 levels below their facility and replicate reports for contacts 2 levels below their facility and replicate primary contacts. For a chw at level2, it will replicate contacts at level2, level3 and level4, along with their reports. They will also replicate the primary contact of a place at level4, even if the primary contact is a child of a level5 contact, along with this contact’s reports.\nA user that has the supervisor role is allowed to replicate contacts 2 levels below their facility and replicate reports for contacts 1 level below their facility and replicate primary contacts. A supervisor at level2 will replicate the same contacts as the chp role above. Similar to the chp, they will replicate primary contacts for places at level4, but the supervisor users will not replicate the reports of primary contacts because a primary contact of a level4 place has a depth of 2. The supervisor will replicate reports for primary contacts of places at level2 or level3.","report-depth#Report Depth":"As of 3.10, report_depth works similarly to depth, but it’s applied to reports (documents with \"type\": \"data_record\") alone, excepting reports that are submitted by the authenticated user.

in milliseconds. min The smallest time recorded in milliseconds. max The largest time recorded in milliseconds. count The number of times recorded. sumsqr The sum of squares of the times recorded in milliseconds. This is useful to see the variance, for example, a lower sumsqr can be indicative of having data closer together. The CHT records the Apdex (Application Performance Index) that is an open standard for measuring performance of software applications. Its purpose is to convert measurements into insights about user satisfaction, by specifying a uniform way to analyze and report on the degree to which measured performance meets user expectations.\nThe Apdex level is satisfied when the duration is less than or equal to 3s; tolerable when the duration is more than 3s but less than or equal to 12s; frustrated when duration is more than 12s. The Apdex is recorded as a telemetry entry using the format: :apdex:, for example, if the telemetry is about boot time and it had a tolerable performance, the Apdex is recorded as boot_time:apdex:tolerable.\nNote that this is not the same as synchronizing to the server apdex.\nFind below the list of telemetry data recorded by CHT:\nField Description Apdex boot_time The overall boot time including loading the code, purging, and accessing the database.

We envision a world where primary health care is equitable, accessible, and delivered by people who are trusted in their communities. Start with the CHT overview, and join the community forum! Community health systems can dramatically improve the accessibility, quality, speed, and equity of primary health care, but only if health workers are effectively equipped and supported. Advances in open source technology are making it easier and more affordable than ever to deliver impactful, dignified care in even the hardest-to-reach communities.\nWith thousands of health workers using these tools to support a million home visits every month, the CHT is the most full-featured, mature, and widely-used open source software toolkit designed specifically for community health systems. Hundreds of individuals contribute to the CHT as designers, developers, researchers, health policy experts, health system implementers, and frontline health workers.","build-once-deploy-for-everyone#Build once, deploy for everyone":"By design, CHT applications do not rely on proprietary hardware or operating systems. They can run on any device that health workers have – whether it is basic phones (via SMS), smartphones, tablets, or computers. The same source code powers the experience, meaning that the app you see on your desktop is the same app you see on your mobile device. Having common code for all devices reduces the barriers for users, and makes the digital health toolks easier to maintain.\nApps built with the Core Framework are fully responsive Progressive Web Applications (PWA). The app content will use the available screen space, showing a single-panel mobile layout for small screens on phones, and show a two-panel layout for larger devices like tablets, laptops, and desktop computers. As a PWA, CHT apps get the best of open web standards while also getting native-like capabilities to reach anyone, anywhere, on any device – all with a single codebase. For more about how CHT Apps and other PWAs integrate the best of native apps and the open web, see the post What are Progressive Web Apps? on web.dev.","made-for-localization#Made for localization":"Apps can be customized for different deployments and types of workflows. The Core Framework has been used in dozens of countries around the world with localization settings.\nUsers can currently interact with the app in English, French, Hindi, Nepali, Spanish, Swahili, Arabic, or Indonesian and new languages can be added in the admin console. The app also supports Bikram Sambat or Gregorian calendars and localized date formatting.","offline-first-technology#Offline-first technology":"Digital health apps need to support health systems in a wide range of low infrastructure environments. Apps built with the Core Framework are designed to be Offline-First and work with only an occasional internet connection.\nThese apps store a user’s data locally on their device so that workflows can be completed without syncing to the server. When a connection becomes available, data will automatically sync to and from the server. Offline-first technology enables health workers to carry out important duties even when opportunities to sync may be weeks apart. As with any app, there is a limit to how much data can be stored locally, particularly on a mobile device. For users needing access to large amounts of data, online user roles are available.","ready-for-national-scale#Ready for national scale":"Around the world, countries are adopting a model of primary health care that starts in communities and homes where high-quality, integrated services are delivered by trusted health workers who are empowered with technology. The scalability and flexibility of the CHT facilitates the creation of holistic digital community health tools that are well integrated throughout the hierarchy of national health systems and across the patient continuum of care. As of 2024, six governments have selected the CHT as a tool of choice for their national community health systems.","reference-apps#Reference apps":"The Community Health Toolkit’s Reference Apps provide templates for structuring and organizing a community health workflow, its configuration code, and testing framework. They include a foundation for forms, data fields, and even analytics, and can be deployed as-is or easily customized by a developer for your unique context.","speeding-up-app-development#Speeding up app development":"The Core Framework makes it faster to build full-featured, scalable digital health apps by providing a foundation developers can build on. These apps can support most languages, are offline-first, and work on basic phones (via SMS), smartphones, tablets, and the web. Rich interactive applications that would take 6-18 months to build from scratch can be built using CHT Core in as little as 1-2 months. Some of the COVID-19 response CHT-based applications shipped in under 2 weeks.\nApp developers are able to define health system roles, permissions and reporting hierarchies, and make use of five highly configurable areas of functionality: messaging, task and schedule management, decision support workflows, longitudinal person profiles, and analytics.\nThe Core Framework can be used to support the unique needs of a given health system and the work of community health workers, frontline supervisors, facility-based nurses, health system managers, and even patients and caregivers. Building guides and tutorials are available to help you kick things off, and you’ll also find an active forum where the community of practice comes together to support each other.","the-cht-community#The CHT Community":"The CHT is 100% open source–it always has been and always will be freely available as a digital public good. This is possible thanks to a diverse and active community of practice that includes contributors from global health NGOs, technical organizations, governments, and research institutions, with the non-profit organization Medic serving as a technical steward.\nThe CHT community’s longterm focus on community-driven health systems, integrated care, and universal health coverage has surfaced innumerable insights that make the CHT unique. We’re also deeply committed to human-centered and participatory design, as an approach to building technology with and for hard-to-reach communities. These principles have helped us to foster a remarkably dynamic and innovative community; learning and building with this community is one of the key reasons people decide to work with the CHT.\nIf you’re contributing to the CHT and would like to see your organization’s logo featured here, send an email to hello@medic.org.\nSee Also: Get involved"},"title":"Why the CHT?"}}
